Netcetera together with Ergon and NOSE is developing the  NeTS  software system for the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). SBB will use the system to plan its nationwide passenger and freight traffic from 2010 onwards. The pilot phase of one of the largest Eclipse RCP projects in Switzerland will run until June 2008. NeTS represents a highly successful collaboration between all the parties.

transports around 285 million passengers and 60 million tonnes of freight along more than 3000 kilometers of track which connects a total of 824 stations. SBB statistics indicate that 96. 2% of the trains run on time. A high. quality service of this kind is obviously the result of very careful planning.

In order to organize the 17,000 passenger and freight trains which travel through the country every day SBB has relied both on its extensive experience and on software. Since July 2007 SBB has been testing a new timetabling system called NeTS. NeTS stands for  network. wide track system  and has been developed by Netcetera in close cooperation with the client SBB the IT service provider Ergon and the design agency NOSE. Following successful field trials NeTS is scheduled to replace the current annual planning system at the end of June 2008. The 2010 timetable will be the first to be created using NeTS.

Vital Experience and New Software Help to Meet Complex Challenges

Currently the 300 or so planners in various SBB offices who are responsible for developing the passenger and freight timetables work with a variety of different planning systems and on the basis of the company's 125 years of experience. This experience is vital. Without it planning the journeys of thousands of passenger and goods trains and ensuring that they arrived in the right place at the right time and on the right track would present numerous problems. Of course SBB is already using a software system for this purpose. However the existing system has reached its technical limits and can no longer be developed to meet the challenges of the future. For this reason SBB decided at the end of 2005 following an extensive tendering process to commission Netcetera to develop a new timetabling system with their partners Ergon and NOSE.

By the end of 2009 SBB will have a unique future. proof software solution designed specifically to meet its needs. The system will take four years and thousands of man days to develop. Netcetera is responsible for coordinating the close and successful partnership between the client and the project team members. As a result of the highly positive nature of the collaboration the SBB planners were able to start field. testing NeTS in the autumn of 2007 and are now providing valuable feedback from their practical experience of the system to the developers.

The new system calculates a train's journey time on the basis of its exact route taking into account curves the specific track and even topographical features. The graphical support provided by NeTS makes the work of the SBB planners significantly easier. The new system integrates three previous individual solutions for planning routes nodes (stations) and maintenance work.

One of the Largest Eclipse RCP Projects in Switzerland

NeTS will not only be able to represent reality more accurately but will also have seamless interfaces to existing SBB systems as a result of its open architecture. One of these systems is for example the train movement calculation system which calculates the exact journey times on the basis of the route and its topography. Each section of track is assigned an accurately calculated travel time. Buffer time for travel and stops can be monitored and is clearly indicated on the screen. The software also allows for precise daily planning using different routes stops and types of trains. Numerous integrated support functions are also available to give SBB an overview of its highly detailed timetable. It goes without saying that huge volumes of data have to be processed to a high level of efficiency in order to display the complex comprehensive plans.

NeTS is currently one of the largest Eclipse Rich Client Platform projects in Switzerland. It has been developed on the basis of current SOA and Java EE standards to ensure that it is open and has a long service life. IBM Websphere Oracle and Hibernate are some of the other applications that are being used in the system. NeTS is a team effort which SBB Netcetera and their partners will be proud of long after 2010.

The new NeTS planning system for SBB allows every route to be planned from end. to. end including branch arrival departure and main lines. NeTS includes a track diagram function and a time and route graph for route planning. The main track allocation function of NeTS will in future allow train movements into the stations (referred to as nodes) to be planned with complete precision.

Android Developer Challenge: .  The birth of public transport app Wemlin

The Netcetera team Daniel Eichhorn and Stefan Ferstl developed an astounding cutting. edge application based on the licence. free mobile device platform Android. They have entered the project called Tramdroid in the worldwide Android Developer Challenge. Tramdroid is a perfect example of high. quality software development and may very soon be ensuring that cell phone users never again miss the next tram.

Android the licence. free platform for mobile devices generates significant interest. Google has brought together more than 30 companies from all over the world to form the Open Handset Alliance and to cooperate on developing Android. The aim of the platform is to allow rapid access to internet data such as e. mails or interactive maps using mobile devices. Mobile data can be combined with data stored on the device for example mobile geo. data and saved contact details. The software development toolkit for Android is now available for developers all over the world to download so that they can transform their ideas into programs.

The objective of the Open Handset Alliance is to accelerate innovation on the mobile market. They created Android for that purpose. The companies Noser and Esmertec represent Android in Switzerland as members of the alliance. Netcetera benefits from its participation in the Android Challenge to which it has contributed its in. depth Java expertise and extensive experience of open source platforms. In addition Netcetera also has a considerable network of potential customers for Android. based applications. Alongside the

the company is holding its own Android competition and has initiated Android prototype projects.

The Netcetera team submitted their project to the Android Developer Challenge in April. The prizes for the development of the best applications total 10 million US dollars. Daniel Eichhorn and Stefan Ferstl's project is appropriately called Tramdroid. As its name suggests the program provides information about tram lines routes and departure times in the city of Zurich. The development process involved data from 13 lines more than 170 stops and 260,000 departure times which the developers have cleverly compressed and concatenated. The result is a highly functional and user. friendly program with a visually appealing user interface.

The concept behind the development of the application is to allow rapid access to travel information in situations where time is short. Current information systems for mobile devices are slow and not particularly user. friendly. Tramdroid allows users to find out a tram’s departure time and direction of travel within just a few seconds. The program identifies the location of the cell phone users and advises them whether they need to run or simply stroll to the next stop. The stop can either be selected on an animated map or entered in text form. Tramdroid displays the departure times of the next trams and in the text. based version the journey time to the destination.

The first version of the Tramdroid software is based on timetables and not on real. time data. This means that it currently does not take account of service interruptions or delays caused by accidents or heavy traffic. Incorporating the real. time data is feasible and worthwhile .  we anticipate exciting developments in this area. However no mobile devices are yet available to run Android applications. The Open Handset Alliance is working hard towards solutions for a new mobile world.

Netcetera develops Knowledge Engine for Health .  Support for Abu Dhabi Health Authority

The Swiss IT service provider Netcetera and its branch office in the United Arab Emirates have developed the Knowledge Engine for Health (KEH) for the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi (HAAD). This solution allows the general health of the population and the overall performance of the healthcare system to be monitored regulated and improved. As a specialist in cross. platform software development with many years of experience in Swiss electronic healthcare projects Netcetera utilised a data model to develop the business intelligence solution which converts electronic claims submitted to health insurance companies by service providers into an analytical database that can be used for general strategic purposes.

to ensure the quality of medical care in the emirate. The mature high. performance business intelligence solution captures electronic data routinely exchanged between healthcare providers and health insurance companies. The extensive anonymised data elements on the forms are mapped into a multi. dimensional data cube. This allows the data to be analysed according to diverse needs. In the meantime Netcetera has also deployed KEH at the National Health Insurance Company Daman in Abu Dhabi.

“Netcetera’s agile deployment of deep expertise has been critical in delivering this demanding solution during a period of rapid health system reform,” said Dr. Philipp Vetter Director of Strategy at the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi. “The design and high quality of the software is such that we now license KEH to payers and providers under an open source agreement which is proving to be of significant value for our stakeholders. We value Netcetera’s willingness to partner with us and challenge us while adapting very flexibly to our specific needs and reliably delivering solutions that do not compromise on quality. ”

“Our technology expertise and our many years of experience with the Swiss healthcare system were very helpful in the development process.

The new ESISplus IT system: Automatic Processes support Event Monitoring and Management in Power Distribution Grid

In cooperation with ZÃ¼richâ€™s energy company ewz Swiss IT service provider Netcetera is developing the new ESISplus event and fault management system for the power distribution grid. Netcetera won the contract in a WTO competitive public tender with ten other bidders and has overall responsibility for the systemâ€™s design specification and commissioning in the fall of 2012.

has been providing electricity and related services to the City of Zurich and parts of the Canton of Graubünden since 1892. In terms of revenue ewz is one of the top ten energy services providers in Switzerland and one of the few companies that generates transports distributes and trades energy. Control centers in Zürich. Oerlikon and Sils/Domleschg monitor and manage the power distribution grids.

The new event and fault management system from Netcetera will be integrated into ewz's distribution grid operations in the fall of 2012.

will take over routine tasks from ewz staff and serve as the central source of information on all events. The new system allows all faults and other events to be handled centrally with good overview thereby improving the power provider's quality of service.

The new IT system incorporates automated processes to help operators in the control center monitor and manage events. Ease of use and functionality of the software have the highest priority. Data from ewz’s peripheral systems is specifically combined in ESISplus to make it easier for operating staff to quickly and correctly decide on the necessary actions. The processes for handling events are defined uniformly and transparent. This allows impairments to the power grid to be corrected effectively and securely. In addition the system supports immediate reliable communications over several channels. The open future. oriented IT architecture enables high system performance adaptability and reliability.

Netcetera is developing the ESISplus software in collaboration with design partner NOSE and has overall responsibility for all phases from high. level design and specification to implementation and commissioning. Netcetera was awarded the contract for ESISplus in a WTO public tender process prevailing against ten other bidders. “We are very pleased that we ranked best in fulfilling the award criteria. After all it's not every day that a Swiss SME comes out on top in an international competitive tender,” said Andrej Vckovski CEO of the Netcetera Group with evident satisfaction. “Once again our ability to develop software for highly complex systems was a winning factor. With ESISplus we can also take advantage of our experience with a similar project for the Swiss Emergency Operations Center.”

Wemlin now also available for Android Smartphones .  New App for Public Transport in St. Gallen and Vicinity

New App for Public Transport in St. Gallen and Vicinity

As of Monday 13 August 2012 iPhone and Android smartphone users can download Wemlin for free. The application displays upcoming departure times for each bus stop on the  Verkehrsbetriebe St. Gallen  (VBSG) and Regiobus networks in real time. The intention is to extend this real. time information to all public transport networks in the Ostwind fare zone. Wemlin was developed by the Swiss software company Netcetera.

This year VBSG and Regiobus AG led by the St. Gallen transport authorities embarked upon a project to develop a smartphone app on behalf of the Canton of St. Gallen Office for Public Transportation. From Monday 13 August 2012 all users of iPhones or smartphones using the Android operating system can download the Wemlin public transport app to their phones. The app allows the user to view upcoming departure times for any stop on the VBSG or Regiobus networks in real time.

Developed by the software company Netcetera the app includes other useful features in addition to current departure times. For example the  Locate Me  function allows passengers to view all of the bus stops in close proximity to their current location. A link to Google displays the quickest route to the chosen bus stop on a map. The app also contains a complete list of stops as well as route maps for the individual transport companies.

Wemlin a Netcetera product can be downloaded either from Apple's iPhone App Store or from Google. Netcetera is one of the top IT service providers in Switzerland and also produces software for public transportation. Its Wemlin platform supplies user. friendly timetable information not only to mobile phones but also online to stationary displays. The

website makes it very easy to create personalized bus stop departure times e.g. on stationary displays. This is particularly useful for schools theatres cinemas shopping centers etc.

Coming Soon to the Rest of the Ostwind Network

The St. Gallen transport authorities and Regiobus are involved as test pilots for this project. In its most recent meeting the fares committee responsibles for the Ostwind network decided to include information from all of the network's transport companies in the application thereby allowing users across the entire Ostwind area (the cantons of St. Gallen Thurgau Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden) to use the app. As the Wemlin app already contains data from the ZVV (Zurich Transportation Network) and Liechtenstein Mobil passengers will soon be able to use one application to obtain timetable information for all public transport stops in the north. eastern corner of Switzerland including Zurich Lake Constance and the Principality of Liechtenstein.

After the summer vacation the St. Gallen transport authorities will begin to integrate the information from the other Ostwind transport companies. The task of extending the application to all areas covered by Ostwind is expected to be complete by the end of 2012.

Soon Wemlin will include information from all of the Ostwind network's transport companies (the cantons of St. Gallen Thurgau Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden). Together with data from the ZVV (Zurich Transportation Network) and Liechtenstein Mobil passengers will soon be able to use one application to obtain timetable information for all public transport stops in the north. eastern corner of Switzerland including Zurich Lake Constance and the Principality of Liechtenstein.

Netcetera's Wemlin now also available for Baselland Transport (BLT)

New BLT Smartphone App for Basel's Public Transport with real. time Information

The new BLT app  Abfahrten  provides the departure times of all public transport vehicles in the tariff authority network for Switzerland\'s northwest region (Tarifverbund Nordwestschweiz) directly on mobile devices.

The app is easy to use and provides true added value for passengers. Especially at stops that are not equipped with digital passenger information screens the app gives passengers helpful information on upcoming departures. Owners of iPhones and Android smartphones can download the BLT app immediately at no cost.

app fills a gap: other public transport apps are essentially travel planning tools for door. to. door trip information but the BLT app is a real travel tool for use on the move. It allows users to see upcoming departure times for any stop in the tariff authority network for Switzerland's northwest region. Real. time information is shown for BLT Autobus Liestal and PostAuto busses; information for other vehicles is based on schedule data. The intention is to extend this real. time information to all public transport in the tariff network.

The app also has other useful functions. For example the  Locate Me  function shows all the bus stops in the vicinity of the user's current location. The app which is based on the popular Wemlin app from Swiss software specialist Netcetera can be downloaded from the iPhone

BLT are also launching their new website in parallel with the new app. About six years after the last relaunch BLT have totally revamped their website and created room for categories more images and news. The main objective is significantly enhanced ease of use. The new BLT website is also available in a mobile version.

Triple Security for online Shopping .  Visa MasterCard and American Express rely on us

Visa MasterCard and American Express rely on 3. D Secure Hosted Service from Netcetera. Licensed Merchant Plug. in available soon.

'   In its data centers Netcetera operates a client. capable 3. D Secure service for some of the largest credit card issuers in Switzerland. Netcetera also ensures secure online payment in Austria and Luxembourg. These services certified by Visa and MasterCard and recently by American Express as well fulfill the most stringent security requirements. Netcetera's 3. D Secure merchant plug. in available starting spring 2013 additionally enables online merchants to handle 3. D Secure payments.

Credit card transactions are essential for online purchasing. However users are repeatedly made uneasy by reports of attempted fraud password theft phishing and much more. Fraud on the Internet is a daily topic and rightly so. Online criminals are increasingly using social engineering methods to access the confidential data of users. The August 2012 issue of Computerworld Switzerland quoted from the results of a global survey by Kaspersky Labs:  Approximately half of the survey participants stated that they had received at least one suspect e. mail from a social network or in their e. mail inbox. Nearly 30 percent of these were supposedly sent by a bank and requested the recipient to provide confidential information. Con artists are also targeting users of smartphones and tablets more and more. According to the survey 24 percent of tablet users and 18 percent of smartphone users have already received a message with suspect content.

For credit card issuers this makes it essential to secure online transactions so that potential phishing attacks are rendered ineffective. In Switzerland for example there are over three million cards in use and the online transaction volume was about 3 billion Swiss francs in 2012 with a rising trend. To reduce losses from fraud card issuers and banks must upgrade their security facilities. In this regard the 3. D Secure standard stands for enhanced security mainly known under the names  Verified by Visa   MasterCard Secure Code  or  American Express SafeKey  seen in online shops.

The Swiss company Viseca Card Services started using Netcetera's 3. D Secure hosted service in 2003. Other renowned card issuers such as Swisscard PayLife Bank in Austria and Cetrel in Luxembourg followed suit. Netcetera also supported the UBS Card Center with project management and technical advice for the introduction of 3. D Secure. American Express opted for Netcetera's 3. D Secure hosted service in 2012. The Swiss software company therefore ensures secure online transactions for the market leaders in the credit card business in Switzerland Austria and Luxembourg.

The 3. D Secure standard for online card transactions provides superior fraud protection for online payments. The customer first enters their credit card number. Then a link to the card issuer is established to allow the customer to confirm their identity using a code. If the authentication is successful the credit card payment is executed. Consistent use of 3. D Secure drastically reduces the card issuer's liability costs and write. offs for fraud. Merchants who use 3. D Secure are exempt from liability in case of fraud and benefit from lower fee rates.

Netcetera operates a client. capable 3. D Secure service in their own data centers. The hosting fulfills the most stringent security requirements of Visa MasterCard and American Express including complex data encryption and restrictive access to the 3. D Secure servers. Netcetera has also passed the Payment Card Industry (PCI) audit. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of regulations for payment transactions. It is endorsed by all major credit card organizations and it governs the handling of card transactions according to defined criteria and processes. Merchant firms and service providers that store convey or process credit card transactions must conform to these standards and regulations.

3. D Secure Merchant Plug. In – Licensed Security

In order to process online payments in accordance with 3. D Secure merchants must use a merchant plug. in (MPI). They have the choice of operating a suitable MPI themselves or integrating it as a service. Netcetera's 3. D Secure MPI available starting spring 2013 supports the first option. This is Netcetera's contribution to ensuring the security of online payments. The MPI includes modern web services for cardholder verification and authentication. As an integrated part of the purchasing process the MPI authenticates and verifies the cardholder according to the  Verified by Visa  or  MasterCard SecureCode  standard. Merchants benefit from the transfer of liability to the card issuer thereby reducing their risk for non. authorized transactions and the resulting reimbursements and lost revenue. 3. D Secure offers merchants a wide range of options. For example the merchant plug. in can be licensed and operated onsite on the merchant's own infrastructure. Alternatively the product architecture enables centralized operation for several merchants via a payment service provider or a bank.

A Nation of Invoice Payers .  No revolutionary breakthrough in sight

'   The Swiss magazine Marketing & Kommunikation addresses the question why new online payment options are developing only very slowly in Switzerland. Purchasing by invoice is still predominant in Switzerland even in the online merchandise sector. Netcetera's experts Thomas Fromherz Ralph Wildhaber both Director Payment & Card Services and Joachim Hagger Head of Market & Technology were interviewed too on the development of e. payment in Switzerland.

E. commerce expert Thomas Lang puts it succinctly:  We're not only a nation of tenants but also a nation of invoice payers.  A glance at the latest figures from the Swiss Mail Order Association (VSV) confirms his assessment: in 2010 the proportion of invoice purchases in the Swiss online merchandise sector was 89% and the following year it was nearly the same at 88%.

The figures for 2012 will be available in a few weeks but there is no reason to expect a significant drop in the proportion of invoice payments as VSV President Patrick Kessler reports:  The data shows that purchasing by invoice still predominates in Switzerland. However collection of detailed figures is limited to our members so organizations such as Digitec and Amazon are not represented.  Another factor is that credit card usage is much higher for services and virtual goods such as SBB and downloads. Nevertheless the survey can be regarded as highly relevant for the merchandise sector. Kessler expects purchasing by invoice to remain dominant in the Swiss online mail. order business.

Some webshops are naturally reluctant to ship a product with the risk that the customer may not pay. However there are now established methods for automatic credit checking. Factoring firms such as Billpay Arvato Infoscore or Post Debitoren acquire receivables for a fee of a few percent of sales volume as noted by Thomas Lang a partner in the consulting firm Carpathia. Paypal as a payment intermediary has also become well established as an alternative to credit cards. Small purchases such as e. books or MP3 files remain a challenge for e. commerce because payment by invoice is not practical for these transactions.

Payment by invoice will continue to play a major role in the foreseeable future,  according to Rui Huang Senior Product Manager E. Commerce at SIX Payment Services.  However credit cards will still be the most important means of payment for webshops.  On a global scale approximately two. thirds of all payments in webshops are now made by credit card and acceptance of credit card payments in webshops is constantly growing in Switzerland.

At Netcetera the systems processes and IT solutions specialist Thomas Fromherz comments:  Electronic invoicing is on the rise for recurrent payments. Invoices will likely be replaced more and more by other payment methods. The credit card industry is trying to increase their acceptance by means such as making online payment easier while new providers like Paypal are penetrating the market with especially simple payment methods.  His colleague Ralph Wildhaber also Director Payment & Card Services says:  In the coming years there will certainly be more payment options. Technologies and means for contactless payment such as NFC PayPass and others will hardly reduce the volume of invoices but more prepaid cards or secure debit cards for online purchases such as Maestro are likely to do so.  Netcetera's major customers include payment service providers which provide services for payment transactions. Netcetera recently launched their merchant plug. in for online merchants which implements the 3. D Secure standard to provide additional security for credit card payments.

Joachim Hagger Head of Market & Technology at Netcetera commented on future payment transactions:  Additional players whose core business is not payment transactions will join the fray because they have a customer base who use their payment means – such as credit cards – to settle purchases. This includes Apple Google and Amazon among others. The focus of these new players is not additional margin but instead how to strengthen customer loyalty and the purchasing habits of their customers.

Hagger commented on the significance of mobile payment:  In the long term mobile phones will become electronic purses that provide all means of payment except cash. It takes a long time for a new means of payment to become established. However we expect the roll. out time for mobile payment to be considerably shorter than what we saw with debit and credit cards.

Tobias Wirth Senior Product Manager M. Commerce at SIX Payment Services sees the future payment transactions landscape as follows:  On the one hand you have electronic purses or e. wallets which are already being used more and more. Consumers store their card data and delivery address in an e. wallet which they can then use for one. click purchasing. This accelerates the payment process in online shops. On the other hand mobile commerce – which means app payments – will continue to increase dramatically.  Wirth regards mobile payment as highly important:  The share of payments by mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones will rise very sharply.  This takes us into the realm of mobile commerce or remote mobile payment. A few online shops already generate 20 percent of their sales with mobile commerce.

Best of Swiss Web: Gold & Bronze for Netcetera

At the Best of Swiss Web award ceremony on 21 March 2013 ESISplus Netceteraâ€™s event and fault management system for the power distribution grid of ZÃ¼richâ€™s energy company ewz won gold for its outstanding technology. The excursion iPhone App for mobile people  Forchbahn .  30 AusflÃ¼ge mit der Frieda (30 trips with Frieda)  got a bronze award in public affairs. We are very proud that our quality work convinces juries and helps our customers to really succeed in business.

In cooperation with Zürich’s energy company ewz Netcetera developed the new

event and fault management system for the power distribution grid. It went live at the end of 2012 and incorporates automated processes to help operators in the control center monitor and manage events. Ease of use and functionality of the software had the highest priority in the development. Data from ewz’s peripheral systems is specifically combined in ESISplus to make it easier for operating staff to quickly and correctly decide on the necessary actions. The processes for handling events are defined uniformly and transparent. This allows impairments to the power grid to be corrected effectively and securely. In addition the system supports immediate reliable communications over several channels. The open future. oriented IT architecture enables high system performance adaptability and reliability.

Netcetera’s awarded ESISplus software already passed the first endurance test very well on 12 March 2013 when Zürich’s booming west quarter with ten thousands of people and businesses suffered a blackout due to construction work. As Dr. Lukas Küng Deputy Director Power Grid Distribution ewz put it: “At yesterday’s major disruption ESISplus helped me a lot to retain an overview of the information jungle. Compared with our former system I now could really concentrate on my job to inform our customers and the media very fast and reliably as the needed internal information gathering was easier and much quicker with ESISplus.”

To mark the 100th anniversary of Forchbahn and fitting into the communication campaign Netcetera developed the excursion iPhone app  Forchbahn .  30 Ausflüge mit der Frieda (30 trips with Frieda)  for walkers bikers culture and nature lovers. Developing mobile applications and optimizing websites for mobile use are Netcetera’s daily business for years now. The Best of Swiss Web Award for this app is yet a further proof of Netcetera’s capabilities in mobile technologies.

Netcetera helps Abu Dhabi promote good Health .  Online Health Portal Weqaya

Netcetera’s branch in the United Arab Emirates has developed a software solution automating health data exchange on behalf of the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi (HAAD). It supports the Authority’s Weqaya health program also with an online portal that allows observing regulating and improving the health of the population. Thanks to the capturing of individual health data of Abu Dhabi’s Emirati population individual risk analyses can be generated and potential behavioral measures can be communicated directly to the program participants. This amounts to an enormous expansion of the scope of prevention for non. communicable diseases in the United Arab Emirates in particular cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. It aims to save massive cost for the healthcare sector and sustainably improve the population’s health.

Everywhere in the world the cost of treating cardiovascular diseases and other non. communicable diseases such as diabetes is rising at an alarming rate. Although risk factors are well known – e.g. poor diet lack of exercise and smoking – good intentions often get lost in the shuffle of daily life with more and more people suffering the consequences. The United Arab Emirates are among those most severely affected since their population has a high rate of diabetes and overweight according to its

To improve the health of the population and mitigate high future economic cost the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi launched the

program as part of its prevention strategy. Already over 94 percent of the Emiratis’ personal health data was captured by October 2011.

Netcetera designed and developed the key component for this program: software that captures the individual health data of the Emirati population in a database and subjects it to a risk analysis. This enables early detection of existing or incipient diseases of the program participants and ensures earlier intervention within the scope of the prevention strategy. The individual results of the analysis are digitally communicated to the participants in personal health reports by Web or mobile devices. When the individuals log in to their online accounts they are also given suggestions for reducing their personal risk of contracting a disease as well as options for addressing the risks with the specialized healthcare providers. The information and advice focus on diet physical activity and nicotine consumption and supports behavioral change towards a healthy lifestyle.

Along with extremely high security standards the Netcetera software not only automates the exchange of the population’s health data but also the data exchange with healthcare providers. It even captures data from personal health monitoring devices and is open for third party application providers. Those can e.g. introduce new ways of information analysis and presentation. Following the Emirate’s established data standards Netcetera’s software fits seamlessly into Abu Dhabi’s healthcare ecosystem makes the comprehensive data available for future Disease Management Programs regulated by the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi and clears the way to individually tailor intervention programs to sustainably improve the population’s health.

The Account in your Pocket .  Banking via App

'   Managing personal bank accounts on mobile devices is the trend. But many apps are still caught in the desktop e. banking paradigm. That's why Netcetera fundamentally rethought operability and security. Read the article from Â«swiss made software â€“ the bookÂ» which puts a spotlight on Switzerland as a location for IT development.

Daily management of personal bank accounts is being transformed. Driven by the mobile internet trend consumer behavior is changing. Among Swiss bank customers this is especially evident from their changed attitude to mobile banking i.e. e. banking via mobile devices. Mobile payment transactions and stock trading are in growing demand among private bank customers. First generation apps were mainly passive used primarily for viewing accounts rather than working with them. But this is now no longer so.

The software company Netcetera and core bank solution provider Finnova are leading the way in responding to that trend. Together they launched “Finnova Mobile Banking” an app focused on functionality and security. The partners adopted a new approach to usability. “First generation apps were too focused on how things are done on the desktop. With a smartphone's small screen we are forced to handle the space economically and keep the usability more intuitive. We put a lot of work into thinking ‘mobile’,” says Christian Waldvogel Product Manager for Mobile Banking at Netcetera who was in charge of the project. But before innovating usability a security concept is needed that meets the high expectations of the banks and above all Swiss consumers.

Finnova Mobile Banking is applying a three. stage concept. In first generations apps the payment amount was still limited and/or only certain payment types were permitted. This was not just a reaction to the reservations among Swiss bank customers but also part of the security concept. These restrictions have now largely been lifted. Only international payments are not (yet) possible.

The main security elements are the contract number password and a personal certificate. The latter is generated and stored on the phone when the device is activated from within the classic desktop e. banking solution. All mobile devices authorized this way can access the account. The user administers them from his computer and the classic e. banking solution. From here he can also block devices in case they are lost or stolen. Because of this it is also possible to sell or pass on an old phone without any problems as long as the phone is de. authorized first. This also means that in contrast to desktop e. banking no additional devices are required for customer authentication.

Authentication is performed through the existing online banking infrastructure. In order to ensure highly secure payment transactions a white list approach is employed. The bank and its clients work with a list of signed recipients. This includes all participants in the Swiss ESR payment transaction system for orange payment orders (a comprehensive list of every company registered in Switzerland) and many private persons. This is where the list's flexibility comes into play. Although app payments can only be made to listed counterparties the whitelist expands rapidly to include all payment recipients to whom the user has already made transfers from the normal e. banking system and those approved by the bank on the basis of payment behavior. The latter means that if one recipient has received payments from multiple customers he is automatically green lighted for all customers. Overall this covers more than 90 percent of all possible in. country payments from the start. Also customers who require additional security can continue to block all transactions for their mobile device.

As a further component of the security concept native apps for Android and iOS are used instead of an HTML5 app. That takes account of three quarters of all Swiss smartphone users. Not yet covered is the current number three among mobile platforms: Windows Phone 8. That is likely to change as soon as it gains a substantial market share.

A lot of work was invested in security but the best security concept is of little use if the app is not easy and intuitive to operate. For this Netcetera fundamentally rethought the user interface: “Our aim was clear: all actions must be easy to perform while waiting at the tram station,” Christian Waldvogel says.

The new interface now guides the user through the processes step by step. Only one type of input is required per step and screen i.e. a number date or text. In addition no new fields pop up as they could cover part of the information displayed and cause confusion during data input. “Mobile must be simple,” Waldvogel says.

It was also important not to overwhelm users with functions. Several workshops were held on this theme before the project began. They addressed questions like: Stock exchange trading yes or no? And if yes for what target users: Will they tend to be professional or hobby traders?—The focus is now clearly on standard retail bank customers. “We cover 95 percent of all mobile banking use cases for retail customers,” Waldvogel explains. Since many mobile devices have a camera users have a further advantage compared to desktop e. banking. Payment orders can easily be scanned so that neither troublesome copy. typing or additional devices like scanner pens are needed.

However a banking app must not only meet customer requirements: Those of the banks are equally important. This particularly concerns issues like branding and client acquisition. Netcetera has taken account of the first by ensuring that the app design can be adapted to any given bank's corporate design and the latter by providing helpful additional functionalities in the public area of the app. This area is also available to non. bank customers making a download of the app attractive for everyone. And that naturally also fosters the desire to have more: in other words to open an account. The app attracts users with functions like a foreign exchange calculator news a bank branch locator contact addresses etc. Documents for opening an account can be requested by a tap. Banks already saw positive results of this function with the first app generation. Although opening an account with just one touch is not yet reality the next app generation is not far away.

Some 25 banks will offer the app by 2014. Concepts for extending it to banks outside Switzerland are in preparation. Here the right partners are essential. Netcetera is currently considering both options: cooperation with distribution companies or with other core bank system providers. In either case the aim is to expand the potential market.

Together we want to revolutionize the digital payment market

inHealth digital platform supports efficient transactions in Emirates healthcare system .  Support of Emirates healthcare system

inHealth digital platform supports efficient transactions in Emirates healthcare system

The United Arab Emiratesâ€™ (UAE) healthcare system is experiencing constant modernization and is progressing in leaps and bounds. The public authorities the major health insurance companies and various other service providers aim to provide all services and treatments reliably efficiently and quickly. Data acquisition for the definition and implementation of medium. term and long. term health policy must also be assured.

This is why it must be possible to verify the tolerability of medicines or approve requested cost reimbursements within a few seconds. Other technical applications such as a reporting system for logging diagnoses must be offered as services and be made available to all market players. To prevent the theft abuse or manipulation of personal data secure data storage conforming to privacy regulations must be assured in all operational phases and compliance with the various industry standards and regulatory requirements must be ensured. In addition national legislation stipulates that sensitive data may only be processed and stored within the boundaries of the seven emirates (Abu Dhabi Dubai and five others). The applications for processing delivery and local storage of health data inside and outside the country some of which date back for years must now be consolidated with centralized processing and raised to a new level of maturity by a professionally structured operating organization. It goes without saying that the current IT service providers will be involved in fashioning the inHealth platform.

This major challenge is being met by a phased definition and implementation process for the inHealth platform. The decisive market players in the UAE healthcare sector consisting of the regulatory body (Health Authority of Abu Dhabi) on the one hand and the largest health insurance company (National Health Insurance Company – Daman) and a partner on the other along with other suppliers and the operational service providers (such as hospitals doctors pharmacies home care organizations etc.) are fully behind the project. They play a key role in the organization of the legal form and operational implementation or they define supervisory requirements and monitor governance and data security.

To assure relative independence and autonomy a new company in the form of a joint venture of Daman and a leading TPA company is being formed. The sole purpose of this new company is to build operate and further develop the inHealth platform. The regulatory body monitors and controls the process in accordance with the defined governance data security and data access provisions and demands corresponding reporting and audit privileges. The basic funding is provided by a one. time deposit by the industry partners. Operational expenses and further development will be financed by the company itself in stages over the years by means of a competitive and accepted range of services (basic lump sum and transaction. based service fees).

How will the inHealth platform be implemented and operated? As a starting point an approach that allows the platform and its services to grow further in line with demand and needs has been chosen. Specifically this means that in the first phase applications will be selected that provide high benefits and meet an urgent need for consolidated and standardized operation. The IT performance attributes of these applications their known and forecast IT resources consumption for managing access request processing cycles and system data their data storage needs (such as short. term and long. term dynamic data) and the general service planning of the platform owner have a decisive impact on the dimensioning procurement and configuration of the necessary servers database components storage components and backup/restore hardware components. The system architecture is based on a virtualization concept. It is designed to be data center independent in terms of physical structure and internet connection and database synchronization is designed for high availability. Based on operational security or political. related factors among others other locations in the UAE may be integrated into the system architecture according to demand in the later stages of the platform’s development.

Implementation of the security and data privacy requirements is a particularly challenging task. They must be strictly observed for the platform as well as for the applications and the company organization. Careful planning of the greenfield approach which means building and introducing the entire platform from the ground up and strict guidelines for the IT operators and the individual application providers ensure compliance with and implementation of the business and IT. related requirements of the regulatory body and the various industry standards (e.g. ISO 27001) and best practices (ITIL). A potential consequence of this is that an application presently running independently may no longer fulfill the inHealth security and compliance requirements and must be reworked by the supplier so that it can be approved and released for operation on the platform.

The agreed security concept encompasses not only the platform. related aspects such as physical environment security access security and others but also the necessary operating staff’s tasks and the requirements on the platform operator’s office environment.

The platform operator implements the interests of the owner from an operational perspective. For example the platform operator advises the application suppliers on the delivery and commissioning of new services. By strict application of the defined onboarding processes (integration pre. production production with acceptance milestones) the platform operator ensures the stabile and secure operation of the platform by means of suitable verification and test measures. In addition proper reporting enables timely invoicing of the provided services by the platform owner. The business and legal responsibilities are assumed by the owner for example by means of service level agreements. This ensures that the platform’s governance and quality assurance are implemented consistently at the platform level.

The e. Government architecture distinguishes between production and distribution. The described example shows how industrial parties (market players IT service providers) can be integrated into the production and distribution of e. Government services. On the one hand the existence of the platform is indispensable for the commercial availability of standardized services (distribution). On the other hand the regulatory body can enforce its interests by using the generated data for its own purposes and in turn using processed data as a basis for other services or healthcare activities (production). This is how for example the current national campaigns to combat diabetes or cardiovascular diseases were initiated.

Many goal achievement principles which are already defined in the Swiss e. Government strategy are confirmed in the UAE such as performance and business process orientation achieving savings from multiple use universal access focusing on prioritization and supporting decision. makers. Transparency and engagement are important aspects which over the long term send an important message to the market and set standards. Since the initiative for the procurement of the inHealth platform comes from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi the  innovation by federalism  principle will only be realized when services are supplied by the other emirates or the services are used jointly.

There are numerous ideas for developing this processing platform in the healthcare sector. For example it could be linked to the Emirates ID card (carried by all persons residing in the UAE) or a personal electronic healthcare card or electronic patient file system. Other market players have also expressed interest in offering supplementary services on the platform. The level of interest and the expectations are both high. The owner and the regulatory body have already reached a clear agreement to focus on the key activities of data collection and processing rather than succumbing to the temptations of a purely commercially oriented market platform.

The United Arab Emirates’ inHealth platform will be launched during the summer of 2014 after which it will be available for general use.

Netcetera and Baselland Transport launch ticket app for smartphones

 Tickets  from Baselland Transport (BLT) is the first smartphone app aligned to the specific needs of Swiss public transport networks. Its simplicity and intuitive operation make access to public transport easier and enhance customer convenience. The mobile ticket solution is part of Netcetera\'s Wemlin public transport information system and was developed in cooperation with BLT and user experience specialist Nothing Interactive.

Over 70% of Swiss residents have a smartphone which puts Switzerland in the top position worldwide. Despite this there are hardly any apps for Swiss public transport customers that make it easy to buy network tickets. Scandinavia demonstrates how it can be done. There mobile ticketing is common practice. In the Copenhagen region alone over one million tickets per month are sold by smartphone.

The  Tickets  app enables customers to purchase individual tickets and day passes for Switzerland’s northwestern tariff authority network (Tarifverbund Nordwestschweiz) quickly easily and reliably. Just two clicks to the desired ticket is the aim.

The design of the app has intentionally been kept simple to make access easy especially for passengers who are not computer whizzes. The well organized clear app design supports intuitive navigation. All processes are automated as much as possible including localization price calculation and language selection (German French or English).

Presently credit cards (MasterCard or Visa) and the Swiss Post bank card (PostFinance) are accepted for payment. The card is acquired immediately and one. time. only with the first ticket purchase. To ensure a high level of security credit card data is not stored on the smartphone.

The  ticket preference  function allows users to define their desired profile (full fare half fare first class second class). Optional features include sending a receipt to a user. defined e. mail address and activation of a password for purchase confirmation (for child safety).

The functional scope of the app has intentionally been limited to a core set to ensure clarity and simplicity. The highest priority right now is the market and customer acceptance setting the pace for the further development of the product.

The future focus also includes additional means of payment. The aim here is to enable customers who do not have a credit card or PostFinance card to use the app.

The app is available for iOS and Android and can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play.

The app was conceptualized by BLT and is part of the Wemlin public transport information system from the Swiss software company Netcetera. For  Tickets  Netcetera acted as prime contractor and was responsible for the technical implementation in collaboration with user experience specialist Nothing Interactive responsible for the visual appearance and the interaction design.

Switzerland mobilizes against cash .  Switzerland mobilizes against cash

'   The Swiss love cash. But that will all change with contactless payments using credit cards and smartphones. This year several initiatives have started in Switzerland that should make cashless payments more attractive to customers. The systems differ a lot. Read how Netcetera's expert Thomas Fromherz Head of Payment & Card Services assesses the current situation surrounding mobile payments in Switzerland and more.

The world of payments has been clearly regulated for a long time particularly for Swiss consumers for whom the most important thing was to have cash in their wallets. Aside from that they had a debit card for small amounts and a credit card for large amounts and abroad. In the past this trio always stood the test against innovative ideas. However now digital solutions are presenting competition for cash. The latest is the realistic vision of Head of Swatch Nick Hayek. At the beginning of the month he announced that a smart watch will be released in three months which can also be used to pay in stores. Apple wants to market its version of the smart watch in April. But how does the money get into the watch? Many stakeholders have recently launched digital solutions or are preparing them for the coming year. Michel Rudin General Manager of Switzerland’s Consumer Forum says: «Those who are searching for a new card solution should wait if they can and see what the year brings.»

Without Near Field Communication (NFC) technology this dynamic would be inconceivable in the card market. This wireless transfer technology enables the contactless exchange of small amounts of data over short distances. An NFC register can already accept payment from corresponding cards now .  these must be held flat against the device for data transfer. And in Switzerland the NFC network is very close. knit. It is being provided by big retailers such as Coop and Migros the SBB and chains such as McDonald's. At no extra cost to the customer soon all Swiss cards should be NFC. enabled. According to industry statements over 83,000 terminals are currently contactless and around 2.5 million cards .  just under 50 percent of cards .  are NFC. enabled. However depending on the card issuer the proportion is much higher. One in five customers paying by card at one of the 8,500 NFC registers at Migros does so using contactless payment. Migros measured the best values at the Subito self. checkout stations where smaller purchases are usually made. Ninety percent of purchases were for an amount less than 40 Francs; a PIN must only be entered when it gets more expensive.

«All well and good but the real added value for customers comes when they no longer need to take out a card,» says Thomas Fromherz Head of Payment & Card Services at the Zürich. based software house Netcetera. According to industry forecasts there is huge growth potential for making payments using a smartphone. Theoretically this has been possible at NFC registers in Switzerland since July 2014: Swisscom has launched its App called Tapit. Currently the service works with Cornècard and Viseca cards and on many Android models. In the meantime the app has been downloaded around 10,000 times but Tapit is still slow to get off the ground. This is no surprise to industry insider Fromherz. For him the payment solution is quite mature but the customer must cross a high threshold in order to register credit cards e.g. request a special SIM card for their mobile phone. Meanwhile Apple has demonstrated how easy it can be to get going. Since September 2014 Apple Pay has been off to a successful start in the US market. The customer can digitally store different cards in a wallet and pay using a fingerprint scan. Fromherz says: «Integrating the cards took me a few minutes. Payment is intuitive and secure with the fingerprint scan.»

It should get just as easy in Switzerland .  for this reason the Swiss card industry have joined forces. Under the project name Swissalps and with high pressure they are working on the technical implementation of a neutral wallet solution. Apple Pay should also be integrated into the standardized ecosystem for online and mobile payments. The project is led by the Zürich. based Aduno Group; the financial services provider provides cards through its subsidiary Viseca. All Swiss credit card issuers (Mastercard Visa and American Express) are involved in Swissalps. Meanwhile Migros and Postfinance are also tinkering on their own applications for mobile payments. At Migros it will deal with the payments in its own stores; specific information is not yet known. Postfinance is currently allowing its subsidiary Twint to develop an identically named app which will be introduced this summer. Completely independent of credit or debit cards the free app should work as a prepaid wallet with different charging options. However Twint does not rely on NFC technology but rather Bluetooth on a different wireless standard. The stores must once again be equipped for it.

Until now the consumers have kept up well with this dynamic points out Sandro Graf an expert from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW): «Since 2013 many people were afraid to pay by smartphone without a PIN code. Now our studies show that the knowledge has grown rapidly.» There will be a great deal more for consumers to learn about in 2015. Ultimately only they decide what will prevail and which provider they will entrust their sensitive customer data.

Postal delivery works better with mobile apps by Netcetera

By the end of 2015 Swiss Post AG will distribute approximately 20,500 new scanners to their delivery personnel. On the Android devices various apps are installed which map all delivery processes and simplify the work of the postal delivery person. The Swiss software company Netcetera has optimized the scanners and developed three apps for them.

is equipping their delivery persons with Android. based scanners. The first devices have been in use since October 2014. Until the end of 2015 approximately 20,500 post scanners will eventually be distributed. Different apps will be installed on the devices to facilitate the work of the delivery personnel.

Easier for the daily lives of postal delivery workers

In addition to scanner optimization Netcetera has developed three applications that provide support to mail carriers in their daily work. They can enter their working hours quickly and directly on the scanner using the app. While loading the delivery vehicles another Netcetera app can be used for scanning in the case of special items such as Swiss. Express  Moon  packages. This allows you to track the transportation progress to the receiver in real. time. Thanks to the third app from Netcetera postal customers can pay more quickly and conveniently at their own door. The full range of services and charges can be paid by different methods (cash invoice postage stamps). In the future these payment apps can be easily used for cashless and paperless payments.

«The apps by Netcetera are easy to use and greatly simplify the lives of our deliverers. Thanks to these apps our deliverers can work efficiently and leave a professional and competent impression with our customers,» says Artur Tomczak Program Manager for Reorientation of Postal Mobile Computing satisfied by the work of Netcetera.

Andrej Vckovski CEO of Netcetera is pleased with the positive reactions of postal mail deliverers to the new scanner. «Five years ago we helped PostFinance to launch the first iApp with a payment function in Switzerland. Now we can impress with our knowledge and expertise about payment systems mobile devices and automated mobile testing.»

Many banks are losing touch with the mobile banking trend .  Many banks are losing touch with the mobile banking trend

Many banks are losing touch with the mobile banking trend

Banks are increasingly confronted with the change to digital business models. The rapid spread of mobile devices has a major impact on how we use our bank accounts. According to a study by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences many banks are falling seriously behind in mobile banking. Over 50 percent of internet accesses in Switzerland now involve mobile devices. Anyone who misses this trend risks being left behind by the competition.

Increasing deployment of digital business models and a trend towards greater use of online products and services have been evident in the retail banking sector for years. In their latest bank survey in 2014 the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences examined how Swiss banks deal with technological trends such as mobile banking. The study authors concluded that the banks need to focus more on new digital technologies and said that banks are falling seriously behind in the digital race.

The banks need to embrace this trend as otherwise their direct competitors or large technology companies could meet their customers' needs better in the future. Apple Google and Facebook have been trying to penetrate the cashless payment market for a good while already. There is a real demand for this technology as can be seen from the above. mentioned study. However it is worth noting that bank customers prefer the mobile banking services of their own banks for security and privacy reasons.

The Swiss software company Netcetera which also has a branch in Vaduz recognized the growing significance of mobile banking at an early stage. In 2010 they developed the first Swiss payment app for PostFinance. Since then Netcetera has become the undisputed market leader for mobile banking in Switzerland. Finnova which supplies the most popular bank software in Switzerland to over 100 customers has been a key partner in this evolution.

The two companies forged their strategic partnership in 2012. A year later they launched the Finnova Mobile Banking app which enables bank customers to access their accounts make payments and place orders on the stock exchange anytime and anywhere. However the mobile banking app is not only intended to serve the customers; the bank's requirements are just as important. It contributes to brand maintenance and customer acquisition by incorporating the bank's corporate design and providing additional functions such as a currency calculator news branch locations and more. Mobile banking can also be implemented much faster and cheaper than with an independent in. house solution. More than 50 banks are now using this app.

When we look at the future of mobile banking we see a trend towards personal finance management (PFM) with specific analysis tools for this purpose. Smart account statements are a key element of this because they allow incomes and expenditures to be classified and analyzed automatically. This gives bank customers a better overview of their accounts and enables them to draft personal budgets or financial plans.

Banks that embrace digital business models and prepare themselves for the future of mobile banking will be better positioned to meet the needs of their customers and stay ahead of the competition.

Wemlin's time to shine .  App for Apple Watch

Netcetera brings mobile travel assistant to the Apple Watch

The Swiss software company Netcetera has developed their first smartwatch app. Wemlin provides information on the nearest public transport stop and all upcoming departures right to the Apple Watch.

With Wemlin for the Apple Watch Netcetera creates a practical assistant for public transport in Switzerland. The app determines the position of the smartwatch wearer and finds the nearest stops or stations. Upcoming departures are then displayed on the watch. For public transport networks offering real. time data passengers can get an overview of the current traffic situation while on the go without even taking their iPhone out of their pocket.

Wemlin is available for free download in the iTunes App Store. Those who have already installed Wemlin on their iPhone only need to link the new Apple Watch to their smartphone. A Wemlin version for Android smartwatches is under development and is expected to be available in the summer of 2015.

In addition to the application for the new Apple Watch Wemlin Mobile is also available for

smartphones and delivers the departures for the selected transport network.

Netcetera developed Wemlin Tickets especially for transport companies. Passengers can use these Android and iOS apps across the majority of Switzerland's German. speaking public transport network to buy their tickets easily and securely in just two clicks. Baselland Transport AG (BLT) was the first provider to launch their «Tickets» app for Tarifverbund Nordwestschweiz (TNW) in August 2014. Since then ticket sales have steadily increased and additional transport networks and companies in the regions of Lucerne Freiburg Bern and St. Gallen have also decided to rely on Wemlin Tickets.

With Wemlin POS Netcetera has created a public transport departure display that works not only at bus stops and train stations but also in stores restaurants and offices. The web. based software runs on an Internet. capable screen with Ostwind being the latest transit authority to use Wemlin POS.

Wemlin is available for free download in the iTunes App Store. Those who have already installed Wemlin on their iPhone only need to link the new Apple Watch to their smartphone.

Netcetera and SIX developing future Swiss payment system .  SIX launches euroSIC

SIX Interbank Clearing (SIX) launched the euroSIC payment system in 1999. It settles euro payments between Swiss banks in real time and is based on the Swiss franc payment system SIC. However its 25. year. old architecture is now reaching its limits.

In collaboration with strategic IT partner Netcetera SIX is now launching the new generation euroSIC to be followed in 2016 by the launch of SIC.

enables efficient economical and real. time worldwide access to payment transactions in the euro market and the Swiss financial economy. SIX operates the

interbank payment system (in Swiss francs) on behalf and under the supervision of the Swiss National Bank as well as the euroSIC system for euro payments on behalf of the Swiss finance sector. Since April 2012 a joint team with extensive experience and professional expertise in the finance sector has been working on the new SIC4 IT architecture which serves both systems. The first to go live was

on 16 April 2015 replacing its COBOL language predecessor. A year later payments in Swiss francs with the new

platform will augment the existing euro payment capability. This complex custom system which handles funds transfers between more than 300 banks is the creation of 20 SIX developers and 12 Netcetera software specialists.

This major project for interbank payment settlement imposes very high demands on quality availability and security. The methodology is structured accordingly and suitable preparation time is provided for the individual project phases such as development and testing.

The developers implemented a new architecture from the ground up. The Java. based software meets stringent demands for technology finance standards functionality and compliance. The new SIC4 payment settlement platform is designed to be flexible enough to allow future standards to be implemented quickly and economically. The new software processes over 50,000 payments daily with a monthly volume exceeding EUR 600 billion euros.

A nine. month test phase with the participating banks preceded the launch. For weeks on end payments were settled in parallel on the old and new platforms so that even the smallest differences could be detected and corrected. A long test duration compared to other software projects was chosen to ensure absolute reliability and quality.

The successful commissioning of the new euroSIC system is a major milestone for the project team. Now they are working on the Swiss franc payment system of the future – SIC – which will process 100 times the volume of euroSIC. SIC has the same new architecture as euroSIC and will be launched in April 2016.

Based on this successful collaboration with international allure SIX and Netcetera are already planning other similar projects. For instance Netcetera will be involved in the phasing out of existing SIX systems for direct debit transactions and electronic invoices.

Netcetera launches mobile financial assistant .  60 Swiss banks with Netcetera's mobile app

60 Swiss banks put their trust in the market leader in mobile banking

The Swiss software company Netcetera is expanding its lead on the mobile banking market in Switzerland and adding a personal finance management (PFM) module from Contovista to its mobile banking app.

This module shows a clear overview of account transactions and also contains budget analysis and search features. Now banks can give their customers a better idea of how much they are spending. At the end of May Schwyzer Kantonalbank (SZKB) integrated the PFM module into its Finnova Mobile Banking as the first cantonal bank. SZKB is one of around 60 banks in Switzerland relying on the mobile banking solutions of Netcetera.

The new PFM module expansion of Netcetera's mobile banking app was developed in collaboration with Zürich start. up

. They supplemented their PFM with the necessary mobile web application and Netcetera integrated it into its overall solution. The module offers an expenditure analysis that automatically categorizes transactions. Bank customers can also comment on and tag their own payments while a semantic search feature makes it easier to find transactions. Graphs of expenditures and income allow users to see how much money they are spending and what they are spending it on at any time. Personal budget management also helps them to better organize their finances.

Netcetera has established itself as a market leader for mobile banking in Switzerland. It recognized mobile banking's growing potential early on. As early as 2010 the Swiss software company provided PostFinance with the first Swiss app with a payment feature. An important technology partner since 2012 is

maintaining the most. used banking software in Switzerland with over 100 customers. In 2013 the two companies joined forces to launch Finnova Mobile Banking for the Swiss finance industry. «We are proud that our product allows even the smaller banks to offer a state. of. the. art mobile banking app» says Ronnie Brunner responsible for Netcetera's product business.

As of the start of June around 60 Swiss banks already rely on Netcetera's mobile banking app. Among them are Graubündner Kantonalbank Genfer Kantonalbank Schwyzer Kantonalbank Clientis Banken the majority of the regional banks savings banks in the Esprit network and the majority of Entris Banking AG customers. Netcetera has also developed customized mobile banking solutions e.g. for Migros Bank PostFinance and Zürcher Kantonalbank.

With Netcetera's mobile banking app bank customers can access their accounts make payments place stock market orders and contact their bank at any time. In the app's public area customers can also search for the nearest ATMs and branches or look up emergency numbers for blocking cards. The app which is integrated into the bank's existing e. banking infrastructure has a high degree of configurability and can be adapted to the corporate design. It can also be supplemented with additional features such as currency converters or news. This makes it possible to implement Netcetera's mobile banking solution considerably faster and more cost. effectively than is possible with an isolated proprietary development.

Netcetera is already working on developing new features for its mobile banking solution. In the future bank customers should be able to block and unblock debit and credit cards and manage recurring payments through the app among other things.

Credit card issuers rely on Netcetera's payment solutions .  Online payment even more secure and easy

Online payment even more secure and easy from Switzerland

The Â«3. D SecureÂ» standard enhances security for online credit card payments. In its data centers Netcetera operates a client. capable 3. D Secure service for some of the largest credit card issuers in Switzerland. The German credit card processor PLUSCARD among others has now also decided to move data from the United States to Netcetera in Switzerland and modernize authentication for online payments.

A prerequisite for the migration was the PCI DSS certification of Netcetera's overall system which is already being used for the largest Swiss credit card issuers

and Swiss Card. In recent months data from the Sparkassen of

have already been migrated to Netcetera. In short the credit card data from other Sparkassen are following. With this Netcetera serves more than 30 banks and more than 300 Sparkassen. That is over 12 million credit cards (of which six million are registered for 3. D Secure) going through Netcetera's infrastructure.

The cardholder recognizes 3. D Secure when paying online with the logos «Verified by Visa» or «MasterCard SecureCode» for example. A static password is entered into the web browser. This often leads to payments being aborted as many users forget their password. Credit card details are also increasingly stolen and abused using electronic methods. Netcetera provides a variety of modern authentication methods for more security in online transactions.

With Netcetera's «one. time password» authentication method the user receives a unique password for each payment either through a smartphone app or text message. The preliminary card activation and telephone. number registration have to be done once only via an online portal.

For Swisscard Netcetera has introduced an innovative technology that enables frictionless payment. «By combing innovative authentication solutions with modern risk systems Netcetera wants to make online payment as smooth as we all hope it can be» says Thomas Fromherz Head of Payment & Card Services at Netcetera.

The user does not need to remember a password and retype a code when making payments .  the authentication is done at the push of a button: once they click on «pay» in the online shop the transaction appears on their smartphone and can be confirmed there with a single click. The system authenticates the cardholder for online transactions via an independent channel. Netcetera is also implementing similar solutions for other clients.

Cash vs. mobile payment .  About the future of payment solutions

'   Â«For how much longer are we going to pay by cash?Â» The Swiss magazine Marketing & Kommunikation asks experts to voice their opinion. Reto Gross Netcetera's Associate Director Payment & Card Service thinks that cash payments are not going to die out in the near future. First the industry needs to make cashless payment more secure increase convenience and reduce the complexity of the transactions.

Low interest rates and rising bank charges are again making cash more attractive. Cash will remain the default means of payment at checkout counters for a long time to come. For online shop checkout credit cards will continue to be the preferred means of payment. Any mobile payment system that wants to become more than a niche solution needs to fulfill three requirements: 1. It works at every checkout as easily as cash. 2. It is based on standard credit cards. 3. It rewards users with added value or a cost benefit.

Commentary of Reto Gross Netcetera's Associate Director Payment & Card Service:

Security convenience broad use and privacy protection are more important than interest rates or fees. Relevant innovations need to provide at least the same benefits as cash. In the best case they provide additional benefits for all parties. And precisely because many payment innovations do not take these criteria seriously and ignore the needs of users cash will remain king for longer than intended. Writing its obituary is premature – but that does not make it immortal.

Speaking of obituaries: It is impossible to imagine e. commerce mobile payments and POS transactions without the  Grand Old Payment Lady  declared dead years ago: the credit card. Its global success story has nothing to do with the plastic card as such but rather with global standardization and agreement on a few – mainly two – provider networks. Overall I would love to see a bit more imagination when it comes to means of payment. Limiting the scope of use to POS payments and e. commerce is not good enough. Rather payment flows need to be modeled with a broad brush because the boundaries between bank transfers ESR invoices direct debiting and standing orders as well as payment transactions per se are increasingly blurring. This applies equally to mobile payment. Although the multi. party system of debit and credit card providers is prone to relatively high fees this fundamentally open system does ensure that the payment providers cannot act in a proprietary way.

Users do not necessarily expect a cost advantage from their preferred payment method but they are not prepared to pay a surcharge. The added value comes from having a commonly accepted functional and secure standard means of payment which can be used both quickly and easily. Unless the industry manages to improve security (for example by using biometric identification) improve convenience (possibly through wearables) and reduce the complexity of user login and the actual transactions cash payments are not going to die out in the medium term.

Prevent fraud using an app and risk analysis system .  3. D Secure: Security and convenience for online shopping

Prevent fraud using an app and risk analysis system

Better security and convenience when shopping online using a credit card: customers retailers and card issuers alike are reaping the benefits of modern authentication methods using smartphone apps and effective risk analysis.

In online retailing classic authentication of credit card transactions by entering the card number CVV expiry date and name of the cardholder has never really provided adequate protection against fraud. This is why Visa created the 3. D Secure (3DS) protocol back in 1998. Today it is used by every card issuer. 3DS helps prevent fraud by adding an additional level of authentication involving the buyer.

In its simplest incarnation the cardholder enters a static password they chose upon registering the card. This can be countered relatively easily though as scammers invariably know many ways of finding out someone’s password. People also quite often forget their password and this results in many cancelled transactions and requests for information – an irritation to both buyers and retailers alike.

A dynamic password i.e. a fresh password that is generated with every transaction and sent to the customer via a separate channel for example by text message is more convenient and secure. The mTAN method has completely replaced the static password in many situations. The customer no longer has to memorize anything – they just have to enter the code they receive when checking out.

It is even more user. friendly to omit this step too: The state. of. the. art authentication method involves using a mobile app on a smartphone which in turn displays payment details such as the amount and receiving party for verification by the customer. The transaction can then be authenticated at a click of a button. The app communicates with the authentication server via a secure data channel separate from the store’s own communications.

The majority of transactions are legitimate – only a small percentage are fraudulent. Using a preliminary risk analysis system it is even possible to eliminate the authentication on the customer’s side which makes the process even more user. friendly. This could be used for transactions that match the profile of the customer’s past purchasing behavior for example. The risk analysis system can also be simultaneously used to spot and block fraudulent transactions.

Credit card issuers are increasingly using the services of third parties to manage the authentication process. Netcetera provides access to 3DS infrastructure with modern authentication and risk analysis processes. Its highly secure services are hosted in Switzerland and can easily be integrated into existing solutions.

This environment meets the high security requirements of Visa and MasterCard and is PCI DSS certified. The 3DS infrastructure is also an important component of

the payment solution recently launched by Netcetera the Aduno Group and Swisscard.

Wemlin app automatically calculates supplementary zones .  App automatically calculates supplementary zones

Public transport authorities simplify ticket sales with Wemlin Tickets

The new Supplementary Tickets function of the Wemlin Tickets smartphone app is smarter than ticket machines. After storing their pass details travelers only have to enter their destination to buy a supplementary ticket.

Wemlin Tickets calculates the necessary additional zones so travelers always buy the right ticket. Seven public transport authorities now rely on the Wemlin app for easy and convenient ticket purchase: Baselland Transport Lucerne transit agency Fribourg public transport Bern Lötschberg Simplon Rail St. Gallen transport authority and most recently STI Thun transport authority and Schaffhausen transport authority.

Supplementary tickets are available in many public transport networks to allow monthly or yearly pass holders to cover extra zones. With conventional self. service ticket machines customers have to use a zone map to determine the necessary additional zones. That leads to many mistakes. The Wemlin Tickets smartphone app from Netcetera simplifies the purchase of supplementary tickets and ensures that travelers buy the right ticket.

Travelers can enter previously purchased zones and passes very easily in the app. After the destination is selected Wemlin Tickets automatically calculates the necessary extra zones. That enormously simplifies the purchase process by saving travelers the trouble of consulting zone maps to determine the required ticket. It also avoids mistakes due to incorrectly determined zones or wrong route/transfer data. Of course travelers can still purchase supplementary tickets in the usual way by selecting the required number of zones directly and consulting the zone map if necessary.

«There is a high error rate with supplementary tickets bought from ticket machines. I am very pleased that the new function of our public transport tickets app öV. TICKET makes it much easier for our customers to buy supplementary tickets totally in line with our tickets app slogan ”child’s play”.» says Beat Nater Manager Sales & Marketing at Lucerne transit agency.

Wemlin Tickets offers even more: along with conventional single tickets multi. trip tickets and supplementary tickets travelers can now purchase multi. day tickets with Wemlin Tickets. Night owls and people travelling after 9am also benefit. They can purchase their night surcharge or 9am day ticket conveniently with their smartphone. The existing childproof function with a password is now supplemented by Touch ID for easy authentication with the user's fingerprint.

Convenient ticket purchase in most Swiss public transport networks

Seven transport authorities are simplifying ticket purchase in public transport networks: Baselland Transport in the Northwest Switzerland public transport network (TNW Tickets) Lucerne transit agency with the Passepartout public transport network (öV. TICKET) Fribourg public transport (TPF) the Libero – Bern Lötschberg Simplon Rail public transport network (LiberoTickets) the Ostwind public transport network of the St. Gallen transport authority (OSTWIND Tickets) STI Thun transport authority (STI Tickets) and the Flextax public transport network of the Schaffhausen transport authority (Flexi Ticket). Travelers can pay securely and easily with all commonly used credit cards (Visa MasterCard American Express) the PostFinance Card Swisscom Easypay (mobile account) and soon Twint.

«We are proud that Wemlin Tickets now covers most public transport networks in Switzerland making local public transport ticket purchase much easier and more convenient for travelers,» says Ronnie Brunner Head of Products at Netcetera.

The apps can be downloaded from the app stores free of charge.

LiveGuide: the digital traveling compagnion for Zentralbahn .  First railway company using RailVista

The Zentralbahn app LiveGuide is a digital traveling companion for passengers traveling between Lucerne and Interlaken.

The app offers general information about the route as well as interesting landmarks which are automatically updated throughout your journey based on your GPS location. LiveGuide is based on Netcetera's product RailVista.

Travelers can use the app to get background information about the Zentralbahn the route and the most interesting sights along the way on their smartphone or tablet. At any time travelers can see where they are on the map and when they will pass the next landmark. These landmarks appear automatically on the screen as soon as the train gets close. «The Zentralbahn is proud to offer this innovation to its travelers,» said Renato Fasciati CEO of the Zentralbahn with excitement. «This offer aligns with our strategy to position ourselves stronger among those traveling for pleasure which represent 75% of all our passengers.»

Along with text and images travelers can also listen to most of the information as audio files. All information including audio files are available in German English and Chinese. Users can also watch a short film of the landmarks on the route from the conductor's perspective. «The app offers a wide range of possibilities: Whether text images audio or film – it has something for everyone,» said Renato Fasciati. «And with the Chinese translation we want to give our numerous guests from China a nice surprise».

This innovation in rail travel is based on the

which can be used for additional routes and railway companies. «We thank the Zentralbahn for their collaboration in developing this app,» said Rafael Pérez Süess Head of New Markets at Netcetera. «We are convinced that this offer will satisfy many customers' needs and we look forward to future launches with other railway companies.» RailVista also offers a live video stream from the perspective of the conductor the CockpitView. This places travelers at the front of the action when the train speeds through a tunnel or snakes around curves.

The LiveGuide app can be downloaded free in the app stores for both

devices. The Zentralbahn recommends downloading the app beforehand over Wi. Fi. During the train ride the app can be used without an internet connection which is especially useful for international guests in order to avoid roaming fees.

Using the app we developed visitors can also expand their Media World with additional features. In the app anything that is produced on. site can be stored in a personal account. This way users can access their own clips even after their visit is over. The app also contains comprehensive information on the interactive world a  best of  collection of must. see visitor clips and an overview of Media World events.

The app brought along some challenging requirements: due to the viral spreading of the clips produced in Media World in social networks the usage varies greatly. Also different kinds of devices and bandwidths need to receive the best possible quality. That’s why we implemented the backend with user administration with cloud technologies. Noteworthy are especially Microsoft Azure as application platform and Akamai as Content Delivery Network. These platforms ensure a good user experience at all times.

Media Release: Middle East digital transformation on rapid pace

By 2025 the region is estimated to have 160 million potential digital users

The Middle Eastâ€™s digital industry is currently enjoying continuous growth fuelled by increased enthusiasm from consumers who are ready to quickly embrace new digital offerings thus transforming the region into a potential digital hub.

After an initial phase driven mainly by technology with our clear industry focus we have established a strong position also in the vertical markets. Today our strong industry. knowledge is combined with our ability to successfully master technical challenges in the digital age,” added Vckovski.

Highly secure app. based solution makes online shopping convenient and secure

We have implemented our 3DS DYN product for the German credit card processor PLUSCARD including dynamic authentication and the integrated app from its technology partner Entersekt. Card users can now confirm their payments with a quick click in the app. Insecure passwords and sending expensive text messages are a thing of the past. We make online shopping more customer. friendly and simpler than ever before. Thanks to this innovative app. based solution PLUSCARD now has the most advanced and secure system for online payments currently available in the market.

PLUSCARD the leading German credit card processor provides comprehensive services for banks and savings banks involving Mastercard and Visa credit cards. Altogether PLUSCARD manages over 2.5 million cards in full. processing from more than 150 financial institutions in Germany.

PLUSCARD has significantly increased its users' ease of use for online card payments. At the same time the processing company benefits from the best possible level of online payment security with this intuitive app. based solution. What is more no purchases are lost or cancelled delivering excellent online transaction reliability.

The number of cases of credit and debit card fraud is growing steadily. In addition to actual credit card theft credit card details are also increasingly being stolen and abused using electronic methods. Card issuers and banks therefore need to upgrade their security measures. For online payments the 3. D Secure (3DS) standard delivers enhanced security. 3DS is widely known as  Verified by Visa,  and „Mastercard® SecureCode™“.

Our extensively proven 3DS DYN solution which is now used by PLUSCARD is based on this standard and authenticates card owners for online transactions using an app as an independent channel. The user receives a push notification on his or her mobile device with the transaction data. Then just a quick tap on a button is enough to confirm the payment. Online shopping has never been so fast and so secure.

To implement this extremely secure yet very user. friendly two channel authentication we use the Transakt app from Entersekt. For the Sparkassen credit cards the app S. ID. Check was implemented. This app is customized and branded based on the Transakt app. Entersekt is a world leader in authentication and mobile app security. As an Entersekt preferred supplier for Europe we have made the Transakt app available to its customers since July 2016.

Since August 2015 PLUSCARD has been operating its credit card portfolio over our multi. business 3DS system. This is operated our data centre in Switzerland that fulfils Visa’s and Mastercard's strictest security requirements. In addition the entire system is certified under PCI DSS.

After successfully migrating our credit card portfolio to Netcetera's 3DS environment we also placed this major security. critical project into Netcetera’s hands. The right choice for us as Netcetera has once again proved that they have notable experience in the area of 3. D Secure,  explains Michael Klein General Manager and Business Unit Manager Operation PLUSCARD Service. Gesellschaft für Kreditkarten. Processing mbH.

Andrej Vckovski our CEO adds:  We secure online purchases for 12 million users daily. In doing so we always ensure that our customers have the best protection combined with a unique user experience. To do this we rely on the most up. to. date technologies to make online payments as secure and simple as possible.

Schalk Nolte CEO of Entersekt comments: “Transakt has proved highly attractive to financial institutions affected by recent and impending regulatory changes in Europe. It helps issuers and other organizations meet their compliance obligations while making life easier for their customers. We are proud to work with Netcetera on this and other exciting projects. Through our collaboration companies like PLUSCARD can launch user. friendly engaging new services without exposing their customers to additional risk.”

In Netcetera customers have a skilled partner with many years of experience in the 3. D Secure environment through all the phases of a project. We supports card issuers and banks with comprehensive expert advice in the planning of the introduction of 3. D Secure or in authentication based on the 3DS DYN solution.

VisecaOne credit card app turns one year old .  500,000 registered users and two awards

Just in time for its first anniversary the 500,000 registered users of the VisecaOne app from the Aduno Group have made it the most widely used credit card app in Switzerland. The app which was developed by us and Nothing Interactive simplifies the digital lives of users. The jury of the Best of Swiss App Awards also honored VisecaOne in November 2016 with two awards. The app won the highest award among all financial apps submitted.

500,000 users have already registered for it. We have developed additional new features for the third release in December 2016 making the digital lives of users even easier. The app also impressed the jury for the

and was the only financial app to win a silver award in the “Functionality” category and a bronze award in the “Business” category. The jury's verdict: “VisecaOne allows credit card relations to be managed on a mobile basis and allows transactions to be confirmed with the app instead of with a password. The app features very good usability a clean layout and visibility of only relevant information. If you have a Viseca credit card you cannot do without this app.”

Users also confirm its high market relevance: Since its launch VisecaOne has been ranked number 1 in the “Free finance” category in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for 46 of 52 weeks. The rankings are based on the download figures which illustrate the popularity of an app.

With the free VisecaOne digital service users have 24/7 access to all important information pertaining to their card. They can view card details such as insurance services manage their personal settings or keep track of ongoing expenses in real time. In addition online payments that require the 3. D Secure Standard can be easily managed and confirmed via the app or SMS code.

We implemented additional features for the third release of the app at the beginning of December 2016 e.g. for the Apple watch app. With intuitive animation the user can see the total expenditures for the credit card and the credit still available directly on their watch. Payment and login requests can also be confirmed quickly and securely directly in the push notification message on the watch or on the lock screen of the mobile device.

With the VisecaOne app for Apple Watch you have all the important information about your cards at your fingertips â€“ a simple intuitive overview of your spending per card plus quick secure confirmation of the two. factor authentication requests via push notification and transaction notifications in real time.

All the important information relating to your card is available at a glance

Confirmation requests provide an additional level of security (second factor) for all actions outside the app.

Toward natural conversation with devices .  Behind. the. scenes look

At the beginning of 2017 we presented our initial prototype based on SiriKit. These first steps showed on the one hand current technological limitations but on the other hand the enormous potential of conversational interfaces. In order to overcome limitations of SiriKit this time we used Android as the platform for an additional prototype. In this article we provide a glimpse behind the scenes and share our experience with its development.

We are convinced that in addition to touch and text speech interfaces will play an increasingly important role as an input channel. The latest developments in speech. to. text platforms for processing natural language and software with cognitive abilities are very helpful to us. One reason for this rapid development is the fact that user data forms the essential foundation for the existing business models of many companies. At the same time speech interfaces create new business areas thus forcing companies to act in order to avoid getting left behind when customer behavior evolves due to increased prevalence of speech interfaces.

we determined that SiriKit currently supports only a very limited number of domains and that the speech interface itself is very limited. So we decided to develop a second version of the timetable app based on Android. Our experience and results are described in the following sections. As you can see in the video with this second prototype we have taken a big step forward:

The speech. based timetable app is essentially comprised of four components. The first component is the mobile app itself which is installed on the smartphone and interacts with the user. The mobile app is responsible for speech recognition and for answering user questions or displaying results in our case timetable information. The language is transcribed using

The actual analysis of the query to determine departure and arrival locations for example from the transcribed sentence  When is the next train from Zurich to Bern?  is not done by the mobile app itself but rather by a second component that runs completely in the cloud. For this second component we are currently using Google's platform

. There are several other platforms that offer similar functionality such as

Within API.AI one defines a so. called agent which takes charge of analyzing the transcribed text which means identifying the different entities .  railway stops in our case. The agent can be trained to identify entities in a variety of different natural sentences. This makes it possible not only to correctly recognize  from Bern to Zurich  but also more complex sentences such as  Hello I have to be in Zurich by 7 p.m. When do I need to catch the train in Bern?  The user shouldn't feel forced to adapt to the device. The goal is to facilitate a conversation with the smartphone that is as natural as possible.

Once we have determined the departure and arrival locations we are ready to search for corresponding timetable information. We use

yet another component for this purpose. Since API.AI and Opendata Transport cannot communicate with each other directly we have introduced a third component as a middle layer between API.AI and Opendata Transport. This third component is a Java. based web application we developed ourselves that also operates in the cloud. In the beginning our web application was only responsible for mapping between API.AI and Opendata Transport and generating answers that were as natural as possible in text form. It now stores the conversations and supplies additional context information.

As already mentioned Opendata Transport is the fourth component in our architecture that delivers the necessary routing or timetable information. The use of Opendata Transport is interchangeable in our web application so that one could switch to an alternate provider for timetable information if necessary.

Speech recognition and text. to. speech function at least partially without an Internet connection. However an Internet connection is generally necessary for applications that interact with other providers/interfaces or rely on up. to. date information.

Development of platforms such as API.AI is advancing quickly and opening up new opportunities for interacting with the user via speech interfaces. Even if speech interfaces never completely replace classic touch and text entry methods this and other prototypes show that speech. activated assistants can be a tangible and audible asset in various everyday situations and can dramatically enhance the user experience. But convenience isn't the only factor improving acceptance. Another important factor is the possibility that a person could one day hold a natural conversation with a device. In order to achieve this we want to improve in the following areas:

Simultaneous processing of multiple domains and the ability to deal with out of context phrases irrelevant to the query at hand.

The device is always listening and easily recognizes if it is being addressed or is capable of making a contribution.

A natural conversation is much more than just a transcription of speech to text and its processing. In future we want people to be able to communicate with their devices naturally. We aren't there yet but we're well on our way.

How conversational interfaces help us in the future .  Talk to your computer just as to a person

Talk to your computer just as to a person

Conversational interfaces will improve the usability and convenience for regular users to interact with phones and computers. While for all major tech companies it means more data to do business with the media welcome conversational interfaces as another hype to write about. We have developed a mobile routing app prototype which allows users to find train connections easily. By doing so we learned about the current state of conversational interfaces and how such interfaces will change our interaction with phones and computers in the future.

A conversational interface is a user interface which allows a human to talk to a computer or phone just as a human would talk to another human. No more clicking on icons or entering specific commands. Booking a taxi to the airport will be as easy as saying to your phone  I need a taxi to the airport because my flight to London is departing at 5pm in the afternoon . Just as a human assistant the phone will make a recommendation when and where the taxi will pick you up so that you will catch your flight safely. When you confirm the proposal the phone will book the ride and keep you posted. Or when you run out of milk you will say to your phone  We need some more milk  and the phone will add milk to your electronic grocery list automatically. Or when you have stomach ache you can write and discuss your pain with an artificial medical assistant: “I’ve had cramps since yesterday evening”. The artificial intelligence based medical assistant will ask questions in order to gather your symptoms.

There are currently two main types of conversational interfaces: the voice assistants which you talk to for example Apple's Siri and the chatbots which you type to for example Facebook's M/Chatbot. For various reasons all major tech companies have recognized the potential of voice recognition chatbots and artificial intelligence. Apple has Siri Mircosoft has Cortana Facebook has M Amazon has Echo/Alexa Google has  Ok Google  and Samsung just recently acquired Viv.

We have developed a mobile routing app prototype integrated with Apple’s Siri which allows users to find train connections easily by saying for example “Hey Siri when is the next train to Zürich?” Processing such a simple question has many challenges. First of all natural language processing needs to be applied in order to understand what the user has said. Depending on what language the user is using Siri sometimes understands the destination/location “Zürich” correctly and sometimes it understands it as “Missouri”. Once Siri has transcribed the sentence correctly Siri needs to understand the meaning of the sentence. In this case that the user wants to take a train in order to travel to Zürich and that the user is asking for a timetable. Apple’s SiriKit currently does not support such a “timetable” domain but it supports the so called “Ride booking” domain. We have contacted Apple in order to introduce a “timetable” domain for public transportation. For the moment however we continued our prototype by using the “Ride booking” domain. This means that we have to rephrase our timetable question as follows “Hey Siri book me a ride to Zürich”. Because of the words “book” and “ride” Siri is able to map this request to the “Ride booking” domain which requires various input parameters such as “Pickup location” and “Drop. off location”. Because in our sentence we did not specify the pickup location we will assume the current geolocation of the user as pickup location. We also didn’t say what mobile app to use in order to actually book the ride. Therefore Siri will ask what app we want to use or we can help Siri by saying “Hey Siri book me a ride to Zürich with TrainApp”. As soon as Siri has gathered all domain specific information from the user Siri will forward the information as parameters to our mobile app. This finally allows us to check when the next train will depart to Zürich. There are many more challenges as you can imagine but it hopefully gives you an idea of the complexity of the seemingly simple question “When is the next train to Zürich?”.

Integrating conversational interfaces is fascinating and challenging and we are excited to be part of this development. Conversational interfaces might not work perfectly yet but just as a child takes many years to learn to walk and speak we will learn how to develop and use conversational interfaces over the coming years.

As an experienced integrator we are taking a lead in developing conversational interface based solutions integrating third. party voice assistants with new and existing clients and backend applications. We are developing mobile apps and backend applications using conversational interfaces for various industries such as public transportation payment and retail. A very important topic regarding conversational conversations is privacy. We take privacy very seriously and therefore provide solutions where conversations between humans and computers/phones are kept within premises.

We have been working together with Nexperts successfully for the past three years on solutions for token. based mobile payments.

A better city with SkopjePulse & IoT .  Environmental Sustainable Development platform

Exploring IoT and creating an Environmental Sustainable Development platform with SkopjePulse

As part of our efforts to take a deep dive in the Internet of Things (IoT) world we implemented and launched SkopjePulse.mk an Environmental Sustainable Development solution based on our own IoT platform.

Skopje has been struggling with several environmental problems in the last few years like occasional flooding excessive noise traffic congestions and especially air pollution which gets worse every winter. Besides some measuring done by official government sensor stations none of these issues are handled properly. We at Netcetera believe that by using technology and leveraging the recent trends like IoT data analysis and machine learning a lot more insights can be gained and some of the problems can be solved. Having this in mind in addition to our wish to gain more expertise inside Netcetera in these fields we started with the idea of implementing

SkopjePulse is an IoT platform and an Envornmental Sustainable Development solution. It gathers all the environmental data provided by a LoRaWAN sensor installation and other third. party sources visualizes the generated information and applies statistics and learning methods like correlation extraction and time. series prediction. The final goal of SkopjePulse is to serve as a monitoring portal a credible source for tackling city environmental issues and an early warning system.

One key goal in the project is to involve the community. Besides just being the consumer of the final solution they can also participate. All the data collected by the SkopjePulse network and other sources are treated as open data and can be consumed via an API. Everyone can use the data make their own solutions or even integrate them with the core SkopjePulse system.

One of the reasons for the rapid ascension of IoT is the advancement in the communication protocols. In this field LoRaWAN opened up a broad new spectrum of possibilities allowing low powered devices to communicate at great distances. The entire infrastructure is non. invasive runs on open frequencies and is completely end. to. end secure.

In Skopje we installed three LoRaWAN gateways and connected them to the global community driven IoT network .

is up and running and we are the core partner. Our plan is to expand the network even more to cover the entire city and to spread to some other cities as well.

TheThingsNetwork provides a complete LoRaWAN infrastructure which handles the entire communication routing security and data delivery at the end. One of its core principles is is being open free to use and community driven meaning that everyone can extend it and everyone can use it. Due of this we are already in the process of collaborating with the local universities other companies and communities and trying to make the technology more popular or more used.

An interview about SkopjePulse in an AWS video of the serie  This is my architecture

TTN provides the LoRaWAN infrastructure and hands us the data while we had to fill in all the other puzzle pieces.

The core of the system is the Netcetera IoT Platform. Comprised of several pieces it brings connectivity of the various data sources scalable data storage data analytics interactive visualizations and finally the significance of all the data collected. Some of the notable features are:

constructed as a set of containerized building blocks easily scalable efficient and robust

Apache Cassandra as data storage ready for massive data handling and distribution

multiple interfaces for data collection and dispatching: HTTP(s) CoAP MQTT.

adapters for different LoRaWAN providers such as TheThingsnetwork and Swisscom

building blocks for easy integration with third party data sources

complete web interface for device administration user management logging system status and usage

data analytics plugins for easy statistics extracting correlations and time. series prediction

SkopjePulse is a super set of features and frontend built on top of the platform.

The other major pieces of the solution are the actual devices. For the initial needs we focused on getting environmental data for ambient particulate matter in the air (PM2.5 and PM10) temperature humidity and relative noise. In order to achieve this we made a small batch of custom devices as we embarked on a new challenge for us: hardware and industrial design with embedded development.

The latest sensor on tour in ZÃ¼rich for the MakeZurich hackaton in February 2017

The devices we made are comprised of easy to get components and use the Microchip RN2483 as LoRaWAN module. To bring everything together we designed a custom PCB from which we had several pieces manufactured in a professional facility and implemented the embedded code with the help of some open. source libraries. Last but not least all the devices are packed in custom stylish 3D printed enclosures ready for wall mount.

Currently SkopjePulse is live but still an early beta phase with some missing features. Our current focus is to activate more sensors throughout the city and expand the network. The road up to here was rough having in mind all the new emerging technologies and the still developing standards libraries practices and communities around the world. There were a lot of experiments both successes and failures a lot of new stuff to learn and the occasional hardware dirty. work. We had the chance to be one of the first companies in the area to implement a complete LoRaWAN IoT solution and we are happy that it is a success.

SkopjePulse is intended to be an evolving platform as we hope to get great reception from the community ideas for improvement and new features and of course actual results to make Skopje a better place to live.

HoloLens use cases in neurosurgery .  Successful prototype with the University Hospital of Berne

'   Professor Raabe's team from the University Clinic for neurosurgery at the University Hospital of Berne has worked with us to test new mixed reality applications in neurosurgery. One thing is already clear: The augmented reality approach provides better planning for surgical interventions.

A first specific field of application is the visualization of scan results and the corresponding planning of operations. Existing CT and MRI scans of patients and data from neuro. navigation can be divided into their component segments colored and visualized life. size in 3D. The spatial representation makes the situation more understandable and helps the surgeon in planning the operation.

To this end we've developed an easy. to. use and intuitive app. The app runs directly on the HoloLens no other devices are needed. The doctor loads the patient data directly into the HoloLens from the neuro. navigation system without further manual steps. The patient is selected using a menu in the HoloLens then the scans are loaded directly into the glasses and visualized in 3D space. Various segments such as the head blood vessel and individual areas of the brain are marked with colors and can be displayed or hidden. Segments can be resized and moved with gestures and voice commands.

Insight into the brain thanks to the 3D visualisation

At the beginning of the project the situation was not clear. For example we didn't know whether the HoloLens is adequate for such complex models and whether the hospital's 3D data could even be used for this purpose. We quickly proofed that the performance of the HoloLens delivers true added value together with the development tools and the existing data.

The solution is still in the prototype phase and not in medical use. In our opinion such use is only a matter of time. We have already identified additional areas of application with further potential and included them in the planning.

A revival of a venerable ship .  thanks to 'mixed reality' .  Hololens breathes new life into ship

A revival of a venerable ship .  thanks to  mixed reality

The Swiss Museum of Transport breathes new life into the venerable  PS Rigi  in a pilot project

Together with the Museum we have developed a showcase that incorporates the venerable ship  Rigi . The result is an impressive demonstration of the potential of mixed reality solutions. The combination of historical objects and state. of. the. art technology allows visitors to enjoy a realistic and exciting presentation of history.

The 160. year. old  Rigi  at the

is regarded as the oldest surviving flush. deck side. wheel paddle steamer in the world and is also the oldest surviving means of motorized transport in Switzerland. Today only the hull remains to bear witness to its interesting and meaningful history. A great deal of imagination is required to picture this paddleboat built in 1848 in its prime as a cargo steamer and later a pleasure cruiser (from 1863 onwards it carried passengers). Thanks to HoloLens and mixed reality for the first time the Museum is now able to tell the story of this boat in visual episodes using the ship itself.

Mixed reality is a term that was introduced along with the Augmented Reality glasses HoloLens. As its name suggests it is about more than simple “augmentation”. It is an extension of the real world using three. dimensional objects and information of the spatial conditions. Mixed reality allows museums to “tell” and visualize different stories based on the item itself. This allows visitors to actually glimpse the past. It is an impressive experience to stand in front of the great antique hull and seconds later to see what the boat looked like 160 100 or 80 years ago full. scale to the accompaniment of an acoustical backdrop from each era. Even the interior of the boat can be viewed and is rendered accessible by animations – for instance one that shows the boat's propulsion method.

The size of the object works: this is probably one of the first use cases in the world involving HoloLens and a length of over thirty meters.

The display is accurate: overlaying the actual object with additional models (different generations) has been successfully implemented.

Never mind the weather (outdoor use): in sunshine and in rain we found ways to make the experience a reality without having to compromise.

We see this having great potential for an enhanced visitor experience in the museum. Jacqueline Schleier Director of Digital Strategy at the Lucerne Museum of Transport confirms: “When I first saw the 'PS Rigi' in all its old splendor I was simply overwhelmed. I realized immediately: this has great potential for the museum in the future and our visitors will be thrilled.”

HoloLens at SBB .  Successful test for maintenance of trains

In an innovative partnership SBB and Â«augment ITÂ» (by Netcetera) successfully tested the use of HoloLens. Various scenarios were investigated and tested. In the short.  and medium. term we see the greatest potential as being in the areas of maintenance and training. It is a matter of time until more business areas will be added.

One example is its application to train maintenance. The video shows how an untrained employee can view the interior workings of a rail car at the Bern railroad station. An application could give the employee enough assistance to be able to solve the problem more rapidly and with minimum effort. Alternatively an expert could provide assistance over a video link.

View of the interior workings of a rail car «on. site»

Assistance with maintenance using a camera and remote connection

A more visionary application would be the automatic recognition of valid tickets. Currently these are read manually using a scanner. In future a pair of glasses like HoloLens could allow ticket inspectors to check the validity of the ticket and the person concerned. To do this he would simply pick up the SwissPass and look at it through HoloLens. In addition the number of passengers could be counted automatically which would speed up controls and lead to more reliable passenger numbers. This case illustrates the potential of the new technology but for a number of reasons it is not yet ready for further investigation.

At first it was not clear which scenarios would provide benefit for SBB. The evaluation and test phase showed that initial uses already exist in maintenance and training. More business areas will open up as the devices are further developed. It is not a question of

Voice. controlled timetable search based on Google Assistant .  Google Assistant news from Google I/O

'   The Google I/O 2017 revealed a lot of news in the fields of machine learning and conversational interfaces. We've been working with speech. based applications for quite some time so we were very excited about what improvements would be presented for the Google Assistant.

The possibilities to integrate an app into an Android speech assistant have been very limited. With the new release of the

developers have many new ways to connect with the user. What's new with Google Assistant and what it means to developers and users we've immediately explored through our speech. based timetable search.

The most exciting news is the implementation of so. called cards: they enable us to visually present additional information to the user. This is important since the user can not always be presented with all the information via spoken language in a compact and efficient way. In the case of the timetable search it would be very tedious for example to read all intermediate stations via voice output. Another very interesting feature are so. called suggestion chips. These small buttons offer the user selection possibilities and are already well known from chat bots. However it is new that this concept is used in a speech. based environment. We found in usability test that especially in the beginning users have trouble communicating efficiently with Conversational Interfaces. The suggestion chips support the user during the conversation with the application.

In addition two other visual artefacts were presented: so. called carousels a horizontal scrollable list of cards as well as normal vertically oriented lists. Carousels will provide significant added value in the future especially for shopping as they are particularly suitable for product proposals. In contrast lists are to be used for alternatives. They enable a classic exclusive selection procedure.

For retail companies however another innovation is likely to be most interesting. Actions on Google will support transactions in the course of this year. This means that a standardized sales process will be available by voice which supports various payment options. This includes classic credit cards but also alternative payment methods such as loyalty points. As it has been possible to bind a credit card to an account for a long time the introduction of voice. controlled transactions increases the comfort for the user. With a few voice commands and clicks we can make a purchase. In addition Actions on Google enables order updates. This means that the user can be kept up. to. date with the status of the transaction by means of a push message.

The following video shows our first test with Google Assistant using the voice. controlled timetable search. For the timetable display we use cards and the user guidance has been improved with suggestion chips.

In conclusion we can state that in particular cards and suggestion chips deliver a tangible added value. Starting a conversation is much easier. With suggestions you can present the user right at the beginning with the most important functionalities and speech patterns without tutorial. Cards allow a uniform appearance and improve the user experience. For our timetable search lists and carousels did not provide a significant advantage but they were particularly convincing in the field of product presentation. We're curious about how Google Assistant will interact with conventional smart phone apps and how the associated innovations will change conventional app development.

has confirmed to us that Conversational Interfaces will grow massively in the coming years. We are delighted to be at the forefront of this development and to offer our customers a competitive advantage.

Free rides with cinema ticket and BLT Tickets App .  Wemlin Tickets Promotions. Toolbox loyalty program

Free rides with cinema ticket and BLT Tickets App

Wemlin Tickets Promotions. Toolbox .  Loyalty program for public transport in Switzerland

As the first customer the public transport companies TNW and BLT together with the PathÃ© cinemas licensed the new module from Netceteraâ€™s Wemlin Suite under the label Cine & Ride. This allows the user to redeem two trips in the TNW network via the BLT Tickets app with each cinema ticket. This loyalty program is based on the Wemlin Tickets Promotions Toolbox which promotes customer loyalty and the digitization of public transport companies in Switzerland.

Since 1 June 2017 a promotion code is being printed on each entrance ticket of one of the Pathé multiplex cinemas in the city of Basel. This code can be scanned with the TNW Tickets app and is then converted to a multi. trip ticket with two journeys within the entire TNW network. The cinema visitor comfortably travels from home and back again with the public transport.

The Promotions Toolbox is a B2B application for transport network partners. Any product from the public transport provider’s portfolio can be used as promotion article. The Toolbox offers the greatest possible flexibility regarding the validity of the article the promotion duration and how and how often the promotion codes can be redeemed. The distribution system of the partner decides on the subsequent distribution of the promotion be it at the cash desk by customer mailing or as an employee fringe benefit.

says about the Wemlin Promotions Toolbox:  With this ingeniously simple solution we are implementing a further step in our digitization strategy and will save money by eliminating the paper version of the promotion ticket.”

Altes Eisen oder Talente mit Erfahrung? .  Andrej Vckovski zur ArbeitsmarktfÃ¤higkeit von IT Profis 50+

Trotz FachkrÃ¤ftemangel fragen sich viele IT. Spezialisten Ã¼ber 50 ob sie bis zur Pensionierung in ihrem Beruf arbeiten kÃ¶nnen. Die Erhaltung der ArbeitsmarktfÃ¤higkeit ist Sache von Arbeitgebern und Arbeitnehmern. Enorm wichtig dabei ist der Faktor W â€“ W wie Weiterbildung. Lesen Sie den Fachartikel von Andrej Vckovski CEO erschienen in der Juli. Ausgabe des Swiss IT Magazine.

Manchmal schafft es ein salopper Spruch eines IT. Managers bis in die internationalen Schlagzeilen. So geschehen im Spätherbst 2012 als der indische SAP. Manager V.R. Ferose von Bangalore aus der Welt verkündete: «Die Haltbarkeitsdauer eines Software. Entwicklers ist nicht länger als die eines Kricketspielers – ungefähr 15 Jahre. Die 20. jährigen Typen bringen mir für den Unternehmenserfolg mehr als die 35. Jährigen.» Ferose war zu diesem Zeitpunkt 38. Im Kern trifft seine zynische Aussage aber auf einen verbreiteten Zweifel: Können Leute in der IT überhaupt bis zur Pensionierung in ihrem Beruf arbeiten? Oder ereilt sie die Altersguillotine schon mit 50? Oder gar noch früher? In der Schweiz prallen in der ICT. Welt zwei Phänomene aufeinander. Einerseits wird bis 2024 ein Mangel von bis zu 25’000 Fachkräften prognostiziert anderseits belegt eine von ICTswitzerland und dem Amt für Wirtschaft und Arbeit des Kantons Zürich 2015 durchgeführte Studie («Arbeitsmarktfähigkeit arbeitsloser Informatiker 45plus») dass das Arbeitslosigkeitsrisiko für Informatikerinnen und Informatiker mit zunehmendem Alter stetig ansteigt während es bei allen Berufsgruppen in der Schweiz gesamthaft mit steigendem Alter abnimmt. Im IT. Umfeld betrug die Arbeitslosenquote 2014 bei den 45 bis 54. Jährigen 2,2 Prozent bei den 55.  bis 64. Jährigen 3 Prozent (die Gesamtarbeitslosenquote im Vergleich dazu belief sich in beiden Altersgruppen auf 2,6 Prozent.

Dabei gilt es aber zu beachten: «Den Informatiker» gibt es nicht. Das Standardwerk «Berufe der ICT» listet in der neunten aktualisierten Auflage 42 Informatik. Berufsbilder. Es ist dementsprechend schwer bei dieser ausgeprägten Heterogenität abschliessend festzustellen wo tatsächlich ein Mangel besteht der auch mit Fachkräften 50+ behoben werden könnte und wo andere Gründe für den Mangel vorherrschen. In einem Artikel des «Tages. Anzeigers» von Anfang November 2016 der die fehlenden 25’000 IT. Fachkräfte thematisierte ergab eine Leserabstimmung Folgendes: Auf die Frage «Wie soll der Informatikermangel behoben werden?» waren 22 Prozent der Leser der Meinung es müssten mehr Leute ausgebildet werden während mit 61 Prozent die Mehrheit meinte die Unternehmen müssten Informatiker auch mit 55+ noch anstellen. Die Volksmeinung zu diesem Thema scheint gemacht.

Es ist sicher angesagt Fachkräfte bis zur Pensionierung im Beruf zu halten um den Fachkräftemangel mindestens etwas zu entschärfen. Die Rechnung hier könnte ganz einfach lauten: Mehr «hinein» plus weniger «hinaus» gleich mehr «drin». Mehr Leute ausbilden und gleichzeitig dafür sorgen dass weniger Leute das Berufsfeld verlassen führt unweigerlich zu mehr Fachkräften die zur Verfügung stehen. Ein wichtiger Schritt in Richtung mehr Nachwuchs ist neben der dualen Lehre auch die neue Informatikmittelschule die im August 2017 in Luzern mit einer Klasse startet.

Gegenüber älteren Mitarbeitenden – nicht nur im Informatikumfeld – bestehen viele Vorurteile: Unflexibel seien sie zu teuer von der wachsenden Geschwindigkeit überfordert und zudem noch schwer zu führen weil sie alles besser wüssten. Zudem hätten sie veraltete Kenntnisse. Diesen Vorurteilen stehen aber auch klare Vorzüge älterer Mitarbeitender gegenüber: Sie sind belastbarer denken vernetzter fallen nicht mehr auf jeden Hype und Trend herein sie kennen ihr Unternehmen gut und sie sind loyaler. Aber: Ohne konstante Weiterbildung kann heute kein Arbeitnehmer in seinem Beruf bestehen und bis zur Pensionierung arbeiten. Weiterbildung ist das A und O wenn es darum geht sich im Beruf fit zu halten. Wer sich weiterbildet kann sich einen gewissen Schutz aufbauen: Weiterbildung hilft dagegen obsolet also wegglobalisiert oder wegautomatisiert zu werden. Aber genausowenig wie es «den Informatiker» gibt existiert «die Weiterbildung» nach der man den definitiven «Impfschutz» hat. Wichtig ist dass schon in der Grundausbildung gelehrt (und gelernt) wird wie wichtig Weiterbildung ist und wie und wo man sich am besten weiterbildet. Ausgangspunkt dafür ist aber immer die professionelle Neugierde – und die kann viele Formen haben. Wer nur seinen Wissensgarten harkt oder aus seinem Wissenssilo auf die Welt schaut hat schlechte Karten. Wer sich sagt «ich bin der Einzige der System X wirklich kennt mir kann keiner was» schneidet sich ins eigene Fleisch. Aber auch Arbeitgeber die denken «was soll ich die junge ETH. Abgängerin noch auf System Y ansetzen sie soll lieber unser neues Blockchain. IoT. Projekt mit Machine Learning angehen» schiessen sich längerfristig selbst ins Knie.

Unternehmen sollten ihren Mitarbeitenden interne und externe Weiterbildungsoptionen anbieten – es ist schliesslich einfacher in die guten Leute die man schon hat zu investieren und sie noch besser zu machen als sie auswärts zu suchen. Ein breiter de. spezialisierter Wissenshorizont ist für jeden Arbeitnehmer eine gute Ausgangslage wenn es darum geht sich beruflich fit zu halten. Fachkonferenzen Workshops E. Learning der Austausch mit Kollegen inner.  und ausserhalb des eigenen Unternehmens sind nur einige mögliche Wege die man auf dem Feld der Weiterbildung einschlagen kann. Zudem besteht oft auch die Möglichkeit den eigenen Karriereverlauf den sich verändernden eigenen Interessen anzupassen. Ein Beispiel: Jemand fängt nach der Hochschule als Softwareentwickler an um dann mit den Jahren als Projektverantwortlicher immer mehr auch in Managementfunktionen hineinzuwachsen. Da ist dann zur fachlich. spezialisierten Weiterbildung auch eine Weiterbildung in Management eine sinnvolle Option.

Wie gross auch immer die Fachkräftelücke effektiv sein mag: Es ist extrem kurzsichtig zu denken mit dem 50. Altersjahr sei das Ablaufdatum eines Informatikers erreicht. Vor allem auch mit Blick auf das durch den demografischen Wandel steigende Rentenalter. Hier werden auch alternative Arbeitsmodelle (Altersteilzeit Bogenkarrieren etc.) ins Spiel kommen müssen. Es braucht alle. Aber es müssen ja nicht alle gleich so lange arbeiten wie Donald «Don» E. Knuth der legendäre amerikanische Informatiker der mit 79 als Professor zwar emeritiert aber als Informatiker noch immer nicht im Ruhestand ist. Ihn zeichnet vor allem eines aus: sein kaum zu stillender Wissensdurst – ein nachahmenswerter Wesenszug.

Plundering islands in your living room .  Mixed Reality 3D action game

Mixed Reality can provide improvements in various aspects of professional life. It can help the education process by projecting objects and processes in the real world. It can help medical personnel to carefully plan operations. It can help maintenance workers to easily find and solve various problems. Mixed Reality also offers improvements in the entertainment sector. Nowadays Virtual Reality has become one of the most talked about topics in the gaming industry. Devices like PSVR Oculus Rift HTC Vive and so on bring the possibility to enjoy virtual worlds in your living room. But Virtual Reality as the name implies disconnects you from the real world. Mixed Reality on the other hand offers you the possibility to enjoy the fun of playing virtual games in the real world. This is the story about the challenges and the concepts behind our first Mixed Reality game .  Cubic Warfare.

Cubic Warfare is a 3D action game. You are a captain of a pirate ship and your goal is to destroy buildings on various islands as fast as possible in order to earn as many  Reals  as possible. You are able to play all by yourself just for fun or to submit your score to online leaderboards and compare it with other players.

Cubic Warfare was first conceived as a prize raffle game for one of our company events. The idea was to have the employees compete by playing an accessible game. The best players would win prizes. At the time HoloLens was relatively new and we didn’t have a lot of knowledge about it in the company. That was the opportunity to create the game.

The initial version of Cubic Warfare was very well received so it was developed further and was used at the Netcetera booth at the

that took place in Bern in April 2017. For this event there were several new levels created the ability to submit scores to a leaderboard was added the visuals were improved etc. The game performed very well and piqued the interest of a lot of the attendees. We decided to develop it further and finally to make it available for everyone to play. Today Cubic Warfare is available at no cost for everyone in the Windows Store.

So what were the biggest challenges during the development process?

The HoloLens is a standalone mixed reality device. This means that it doesn't need any additional hardware to operate (like a PC smartphone or something similar). All of the sensors processing units battery etc. are contained in the headset. The headset is powerful enough to display complex models. However it is not powerful enough to perform complex physics simulations or to render models with high. end materials and lighting. Performance is one of the restrictions that the developer should be aware of. To reduce the model complexity and lower the number of polygons that were used we decided that the game should use models made out of cubes also known as Voxel models. Models made out of cubes can be easily made destructible if the physics are set correctly. Some of our Voxel models are displayed in the gallery below.

Scaling was the next challenge. When developing games for HoloLens you have to keep in mind that the objects will be placed in the real world. They need to be in the right size. To demonstrate the problem look at the following picture:

Cubic Warfare was developed using Unity. In Unity 1 unit is equal to 1 meter in the real world. This meant that when an object is created it needs to be really small. If an object is small (from the picture ~30cm) a single cube from the model would be even smaller (around 1cm). This makes problems with Unity's physics simulations. You need a balance between the physics calculation precision and the scale. Because the HoloLens is not very powerful the calculations need to be less precise. This on the other hand makes issues (for example: collisions are not detected). We needed to fine tune several settings in the Physics engine in order to find a perfect balance between the simulation accuracy and the performance (and yes this also included some changes in the gravity as well).

When talking about the physics it is important to say a few words about the setup of the physics model of the buildings that need to be destroyed. Each building consists of cubes. All of these cubes are independent physics objects. However there are cases when a cube doesn't have cubes below it. Think of balconies or bridges. This is resolved using joints as a way to connect several physics objects together. These joints can be broken if an excessive force affects the objects (an explosion for example). This can be seen on the image below:

The cube that is marked with magenta doesn't have a cube below it. It is connected to the adjacent cubes (marked with orange) with joints. The same infrastructure is established for every cube that doesn't have anything below it.

Another challenge was the menu system. Almost all applications that are available right now for Mixed Reality devices provide menus that are similar to the standard flat menus that can be seen in the classic applications that we use on PCs smartphones and even Windows 10 for HoloLens. We wanted to push this concept a bit further. Let’s look at the Start Menu (only Holograms are displayed so that the picture is clearer):

You will immediately notice that there are comic bubbles for the different groups of ships. The group with the single ship (on the left) represents the menu item for the mode where the user doesn't submit the score to the leaderboard. The group with three ships (on the right) represents the mode where the user submits the score. The obvious question is: How does the user know when an item is highlighted. We solved this by introducing an additional comic bubble to highlight the option when it is selected. This is displayed in the figure below:

The additional comic bubble  Yeeey!  highlights the selected option or item.

Also the menu has other items that can be selected but are not immediately highlighted. If there are bubbles to all items the user interface would become too crowded. This is the reasoning behind the decision to only highlight items that are important. The other items are easily discoverable while the user is looking around the scene. The figure below demonstrates all of the items that are available:

Using this pattern we were able to design the entire user interface of the game so that it uses the actual 3D objects to convey information to the user without using standard UI/UX patterns. This allows us to make the user a bit more immersed in the game.

So enough talk. How about some gameplay? Interested? Check out the video below:

If you have a compatible device you can get

Wemlin for Windows 10 .  The app now runs on all devices with Windows 10

The public transport app is now a Universal Windows app

Wemlin for Windows is no longer a pure smartphone app. We have further developed the popular app for public transport into a Universal Windows app and brought it to the latest state of technology. It now runs on all devices with Windows 10. The data is obtained from the new  Open Data Platform Ã–V Schweiz . The great advantage for the users: they can check the departure times of train tram bus and ship of all the public transport companies in Switzerland even faster.

With the passenger information app Wemlin the travelers know the departures in their vicinity at any time whether with iOS Android or Windows Phone. We now have developed Wemlin for the Windows 10 platform. In the start menu view the next departures of the user’s personal favorite stations are displayed. If you want to use other Wemlin features you can open the app by clicking on the desktop tile.

A further advantage is the connection to the new

of the Federal Office of Transport. The platform provides all timetable data as well as the current and the expected traffic situation of public transport in real time. Wemlin for Windows now shows the departure times of all Swiss public transport companies – anytime and anywhere. Friedemann Bürgel member of the managing board of opendata.ch says:  We are very pleased that this popular and widely. used app can now use the new platform. Open data is increasingly becoming an infrastructure that benefits the general public.”

The existing Windows Smartphone app is replaced by the Universal Windows app. The new app can be downloaded

for free. Wemlin for Android and iOS remain and can be used for the Zürich transport network Liechtenstein Mobil and the transport networks Ostwind Nordwestschweiz and Frimobil.

With Wemlin the travelers know the departures in their vicinity at any time.

Wemlin for Windows now shows the departure times of all Swiss public transport companies.

In the start menu view the next departures of the userâ€™s personal favorite stations are displayed.

Augmented reality is here and there are applications that deliver real benefits. But how do you typically set about proceeding with a new AR project? And what expertise is needed to gain a foothold in this field? Find the answers in this article.

After the PC the Internet and the rapid spread of mobile platforms the sector is again at the beginning of the next era: that of augmented and mixed reality platforms. This opens completely new opportunities for applications but many of them are still beyond our imagination. It is not a question of whether these platforms will become relevant just when.

The topics of Mixed Reality (MR) Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are developing rapidly. We hear about new devices services and applications almost every month. But what do the terms mean? Virtual reality is relatively clearly defined .  full immersion in another world using a headset where you are no longer aware of the real world. One disadvantage is this lack of reference to the real world. The user therefore does not move or can only move to a limited extent.

Augmented reality is the field that is currently being developed most actively and is where many companies see the most potential. It is defined as an extension of reality usually by visual and acoustic means. However further senses could be added in the future such as touch.

A simple kind of augmented reality is the superimposition of 2D data such as the distance from a free kick to the goal during a football game. For more enhanced use the space is recognized and 3D objects with physical models are embedded in it. Augmented reality has the advantage that the user can augment his or her real world move normally in that world and communicate with other people.

The definition of mixed reality is not currently quite so clear. Back in 1994 Paul Milgram already described MR as the entire spectrum between virtual reality and true reality. This means that a 2D superimposition on a mobile phone or VR glasses showing an additional camera image of reality is also mixed reality. Another definition describes mixed reality as a subgroup of augmented reality. This advanced extension of the real world with the 3D capabilities of virtual reality supplies an additional understanding of the actual space. Objects are placed in the real space in 3D and interact with this space. The Microsoft Hololens is a good example of this. The following explanations are based on this definition. When we say AR we always also include MR.

It is still very difficult for many people to imagine that VR is the next big development after PCs the Internet and mobile technology. There was a similar reaction at the end of the 1990s when the first mobile phones with cameras were launched. Only a few people understood the benefit of having good cameras in smartphones. But once you have experienced augmented reality it becomes clear: this attractive form of extending reality is not just a passing fad but the harbinger of something greater.

So it is not really surprising that all the big companies now have a strong AR strategy .  Microsoft with the Hololens and Windows 10 Google with the Tango Project Apple with the upcoming iOS 11 and the ARKit framework and Facebook who this spring defined AR as one of its three strategic pillars. But what does a service provider need to do to take those first steps into the world of virtual reality?

When a new technology or platform is in its infancy a company does not generally change its fundamental processes but instead improves them in specific areas. Entire processes are only rethought once greater maturity and breadth is reached. Companies also first consider where there might already be a good basis that can be used in order to gain some experience in their normal working environment. Because of this AR is typically first used in fields such as:

anywhere there is already a good base of 3D data

or where value can be added through use in the real world.

For example 3D data usually already exists in the medical sector. Today CT and MR scans can easily be processed into 3D models. The industrial sector also works frequently with CAD/CAM applications and so has a good 3D basis. There is also an industrial trend in the form of BIM (Building Information Modeling) within the field of architecture.

There are many situations in the real world where value can be added. In industry for example employees come face to face with machines about which they have little additional information. Superimposing this in a context. sensitive manner creates real added value. According to information from Microsoft 50 to 100 service technicians at Thyssenkrupp and Tetrapak have already been equipped with a Hololens. An expert can go on Skype at any time to dial in and see the maintenance work and sees the same image as the employee and can speak to them and give them instructions within their field of view. The employees do not wear the glasses all the time but put them on selectively for processes where they require assistance. This already substantially accelerates the diagnosis and solution process improves the quality of the work and therefore means that the use of AR has already paid off for the company.

Another exciting area of application for AR is in the field of training. The benefit over VR: all the members of a class see the same objects in 3D and can move around them freely and explain them to each another.

Often it cannot be foreseen in advance where the added value can be achieved. That is why it is worth using innovation methods for example working iteratively in a similar way to design thinking.

In order to recognize how augmented reality can add value it is worth applying innovation methods along similar lines to the design thought process.

Using this kind of methodology it can be determined fairly rapidly which ideas and use cases can actually be implemented and provide benefits and which cannot. Only paths that are worthwhile are pursued. It is also recommended to create an interdisciplinary project team. This should comprise at least:

Experts from the field who know or can identify the current pain points processes and data quality.

Experts from AR development and 3D engineering who can quickly determine feasibility and can also develop prototypes.

Experts from the areas of law data protection data 3D modelling or user experience can also be added depending on requirements and the type of project.

The advantage of this procedure is that you take a very limited risk. You can stop at practically any point if it is shown that something is still missing. Or you can go directly into product development if the potential is proven.

Expertise is absolutely essential in 3D development in order to implement solutions using AR. You need to know all about the concepts of how to work in 3D and how to create data with 3D or optimize existing data. The application logic for creating scenery and developing user interfaces for them is completely different to the development of web or mobile apps. A web front end or back end developer may be able to program in an AR environment. But without prior knowledge he or she will spend a lot of time acquiring the skills that are needed for this area. That is why we recommend working with experts as they are the only ones who can ask the important questions quickly and cost. efficiently and really clarify feasibility.

An example: A traditional developer at a company evaluates the Hololens based on a simple app that cannot deal efficiently with 3D data. Because he wants to load a complex object and the app makes this impossible he considers the Hololens to be incapable of processing complex objects. He rejects taking further steps as result of this experience. However this judgement is incorrect because the Hololens can indeed deal with the complexity of up to half a million polygons. This requires knowledge of modelling tools such as Blender 3D Studio Max AutoCAD and development frameworks like Unity 3D. A concrete example of its performance is the representation of brain scans at Inselspital Bern using the Hololens which loads them onto the glasses on. demand.

It is now possible to realize AR applications that were unimaginable only a short time ago. And it is possible to determine and justify the benefit of possible applications efficiently and cost. effectively with a few dozen days of work. This is thanks to major advances in both the hardware and software stacks and the stable development framework. Development is progressing rapidly for example with the appearance of the Apple ARKit in the autumn. The consumer market will see some very good AR apps in the next six months. Ikea for example has already announced an app that allows you to place furniture in your living space at home and to measure your living space simply using your telephone.

In the enterprise applications sector more glasses will follow the Hololens onto the marketplace and will drive the market forwards. Hololens already offers very many functions and a high level of stability and so can be used to carry out its own feasibility studies. Anyone who is already preparing now for the new AR platforms will be acquiring knowledge to further develop his or her business get ahead of competitors or even be able to offer new services or products in this future field.

Augmented reality opens up new horizons in vocational education and training

Augmented IT by Netcetera has developed a showcase for the use of augmented and mixed reality in the fields of vocational education and training for BÃ¼hler in Uzwil.

HoloLens enables students to explore the company's own grinding machines together directly in the classroom in 3D and at their original size. They can move freely around the placed 3D object open the machine and disassemble it thereby deepening their understanding of its functionality and inner workings. In addition participants from remote locations can be integrated into lessons regardless of location. Thanks to ARKit the AR framework for iOS it is possible for apprentices to study the content on their usual devices at home or on the go on the iPad or iPhone.

Bühler is one of the most innovative companies in Switzerland offering high. class vocational training. ClassUnlimited™ makes Bühler the leader in distance. independent teaching design which allows students to be trained across continents.

Yesterday we had the opportunity to present our showcase at the opening of the exhibition “

” where Reto Grob spoke on “Education in times of digitalization”.

The showcase for Bühler is based on our Augmented Reality Learning platform which is available for Microsoft HoloLens and Apple's ARKit and is coming soon to Google ARCore. The AR learning platform is an interactive and collaborative 3D tool. Linking the real world with virtual content opens up new horizons in education and training. The superimposition of three. dimensional models enables learning content to be deepened and better understood as well as allowing for specific support for learners. AR leads to an unprecedented visualization of objects and interactive content. Immersive learning experiences lead to lasting and intensive knowledge gain and redefine the learning space.

has secured $500,000 in seed investment to fund the development of its state. of. the. art solution that provides sales organisations with a more efficient and privacy compliant way to prospect customers. The round which was led by us will be used to scale the Cognism team and further develop its core solution. Several other institutional and angel investors participated in the round including

Tsingbay Venture Capital Tom James James Hodson Usman Khan and others.

“Raising this round was an important step for us,” said James Isilay CEO Cognism. “In the months ahead we’ll be investing heavily in the product itself to move toward a frictionless customer experience expand our ability to collect and reason about data at scale rapidly grow our data asset through strategic partnerships and introduce Cognism to more sales and marketing teams.”

“We are excited to support Cognism on its mission to boost their customers’ sales with their impressive tech solution for delivering the right leads at the right time. This investment also marks an important milestone for Netcetera because it presents our first official investment from our start. up initiative which we launched in the beginning of 2016,” stated Andrej Vckovski CEO of Netcetera. He also added: “James and his team are also a brilliant example how a founder from Switzerland (James lives in Zurich) can build a great start. up with CTO from Croatia (CTO Stjepan is from Zadar) development from Macedonia (the team is based in Skopje) and sales in UK (London). And to top it off we are leading the investment of truly international set of select co. investors – from China to Macedonia from Switzerland to UK.”

Lead generation data enrichment and targeting prospects requires time effort and an ongoing investment. All too often time and energy is spent on this phase of the sales process rather than on closing deals. Data protection and legal restrictions on customer outreach are also rapidly evolving this further challenges the ability of sales teams to connect with customers. To assist the sales cycle many companies especially those with limited resources are turning to automated sales. acceleration technology to improve the prospecting process and ensure outreach compliance in the target market.

“Our technology is built around automated machine learning algorithms that enable us to generate better lead data custom fitted to our customers.” said Stjepan Buljat CTO Cognism. “We’re tapping sources of information that cannot be processed by a human workforce in real. time”.

The future of digital payment .  Conversational Interfaces and Augmented Reality

Our experts Thomas Fromherz and Hugo Schotman show what the future of digital payment looks like in the following video (in German).

After a brief introduction into the history of paying Thomas Fromherz demonstrates a voice. controlled payment with an app. The process is similar to a website. Instead of tapping and clicking the commands you simply say them out loud into your smartphone. Hugo Schotman then shows a few possibilities with the Hololens e.g. how public transport tickets can be easily and quickly checked.

Quick and secure access to all data .  Information system for the University Hospital Basel

The fast smart and secure access to patient or case data is the key to more efficiency in the healthcare sector. We have translated this complex task into a simple and user. friendly application for the University Hospital of Basel.

The result is an information system that makes daily work routine for doctors and nursing staff as simple as possible. Software for Health Efficiency (S.H.E.) is a modular system for data management. It integrates three areas: the patient archive viewer provides the user with quick and easy access to relevant information the findings app notifies the doctors and nursing staff about new reports no matter where they are in the hospital and the dashboard integrates access to all systems. The S.H.E. contributes to greater efficiency and comfort which allows the hospital staff at

Cooperating with the WORLDWEBFORUM .  Strategic partner for Augmented Reality

We are a partner of the WORLDWEBFORUM. This business conference brings together C. level executives pioneers and visionaries from all over the world to discuss chances and risks of digitization. We are helping to design the program of the WORLDWEBFORUM: we exclusively presents the vertical augmented reality (AR) and will also be on site as a speaker.

As a partner of the WORLDWEBFORUM Netcetera introduces the new hot topic — augmented reality. AR is more than just video games: Netcetera shows visitors the potential of AR for business applications and new associated business models and why AR will impact nearly every industry. In the words of Andrej Vckovski Netcetera's CEO: “Augmented reality is going to be as big as the smartphone. Stay ahead of the curve. Because the question isn't if augmented reality will catch on but rather when.”

As focus topics of the vertical AR Netcetera presents how AR supports technicians with instructions which new horizons it opens up in the field of medicine and how it shapes education and training into something impressive and interactive. Among others Bob Summer Associate Director & Principal Research Scientist at Disney Research and Martin Splitt Head of Engineering at Archilogic were brought on board as speakers by Netcetera.

Netcetera has already implemented various AR projects and is doing continuous research on applications relevant for business. At the Inselspital University Hospital of Bern Netcetera is testing new HoloLens applications in the field of neurosurgery such as visualizing the results of an examination (for instance a CT scan) and planning the appropriate surgical procedure. The project for the company Bühler showcases exactly how AR can unlock new potential in vocational training: Using HoloLens glasses and without leaving the classroom students can view the company's grinding machines on. site in 3D and in actual size and even open and disassemble them to better understand what they do and how they work. Applications in the fields of maintenance and training have already been successfully tested together with SBB the Swiss national railway company.

Fabian Hedinger founder and CEO of the WORLDWEBFORUM: “We are proud to have Netcetera on board as a strategic partner for the AR vertical. Netcetera is a software company that contributes a wealth of experience from business. relevant AR projects.”

The battle for conversational interfaces .  When is a voice controlled interface the right choice?

Conversational interfaces are sometimes very useful but the acoustic language is not always the best option. We may sometimes overestimate the acoustic language without realizing that we often communicate better and more efficiently by other means. Learn more in the  In the Code  article by our CI expert Michael Wechner published on inside. it.ch.

There is a war raging between the tech giants for supremacy in conversational interfaces. The winners can collect even more data which allows for better understanding of the user behavior. But what is the benefit of a conversational interface for the user? The poet Carl Sandburg wrote in 1936 “Sometime they'll give a war and nobody will come”. Is the conversational interface just a hype driven by the fight for survival among the tech giants? To answer the question about the benefit to the user it helps to ask “why do people even speak”? Language is a form of communication with which one exchanges information. Information sharing is a mode of survival. MRI scans of the human brain show that the same reward system is active in the brain during sex eating and sharing information. Languages have evolved because they help us to survive. The conclusion is: We should not implement conversational interfaces just for the sake of language but ask ourselves “what helps us to survive”? The use of language follows as an automatic consequence. In the following sections we are giving some examples to demonstrate this finding.

Suppose we fly back from a business trip and want to get home from the airport as fast as possible. However we don't know when the next train leaves or whether we have to hurry to the airport train station. If we had a human assistant who knew the train schedule by heart we would ask him when the next train was leaving for home. The assistant would reply “there's a train in 13 minutes that we can still catch but we'll have to hurry” or “a train just left and the next one leaves in 40 minutes. So we can take our time getting off the plane now”. Many mobile train schedule apps now have a “Take me home” button. This means that the app knows where we live and thanks to the geo. location feature we'll receive a suggestion for the departure of the next trains at the push of a button. If we are still on board the plane we'll probably prefer to use the “Take me home” button rather than the voice interface. It's efficient and the other passengers nearby won't hear where we live. But if we are already on the way to the train station with luggage in both hands we would be glad to have a voice interface.

to digitize the offline purchasing process. It is likely that Amazon will use this process in the grocery chain Whole Foods which it took over in the summer of 2017 for

The offline “end. to. end shopping process” may be all digital in the future. Customers make their shopping list when they are either at home or traveling

. When entering the store the shopping list is arranged according to the shop layout. Augmented Reality on the mobile helps the customers to find their products and get additional product information. The mobile app syncs automatically when a product is put into the actual shopping cart and the customers no longer have to wait at a checkout but can conveniently pay via the mobile app as they leave the store. The voice interface is just a piece of the puzzle in this process. It makes sense to use a conversational interface when entering the shopping list as it is very efficient.

People with muscular atrophy have progressive muscle weakness. Modern medicines may slow down the progress but not stop it. Preserving the quality of life as long as possible is the main aim. This includes the use of a robotic arm that is attached to the wheelchair and controlled by a joystick. The robotic arm can be used for example to choose the floor number in an elevator. In this case an elevator with a voice interface would be the simplest solution but not every elevator will be equipped with a voice interface in the near future. A possible intermediate solution would be a robotic arm with voice interface and image recognition. If the person in the elevator could tell the robotic arm «please go to the 2nd floor» the robotic arm would automatically search for the control panel and press the button for the 2nd floor.

The described applications show that conversational interfaces are sometimes very useful but the acoustic language is not always the best option. We may sometimes overestimate the acoustic language without realizing that we often communicate better and more efficiently by other means. Good alternatives are shown for example in motion. Nature has created legs and fins. However humans have developed wheels propellers and jet nozzles that are more efficient than legs or fins depending on the field of application. It therefore makes sense to first identify the actual problem and then to find the best solution for it.

Back to the question then as to why we humans speak. What options does a newborn child have to communicate? If it is hungry or in pain or wants something else? How often do we see screaming kids and the parents don't know why they are screaming. How else can the child communicate apart from using gestures and behaviors that can be seen? Do we learn to speak due to a lack of other choices?

Toddlers learn about 50 words on average between 18 and 24 months old. From then on usually the so. called vocabulary explosion begins. This means that the vocabulary is significantly enlarged in a relatively short time and the children begin to form whole sentences. There are possible explanations for the vocabulary explosion for example the

even though the scientific and research worlds don't seem to be able to find a consensus. Maybe also because the topic was not relevant enough up to this point.

Like toddlers we are currently learning our first words for the development of conversational interfaces and trying to form whole sentences. The tech giants' fight for survival supports this development. It is still difficult to estimate exactly if and when the explosion will take place. But it's exactly this unpredictability that makes the topic of conversational interfaces exciting!

What the users are saying: Joint study with Zeix

Zeix and Netcetera have jointly conducted a user survey. It relies on a voice. based train schedule app developed by Netcetera as a prototype. The key findings are:

The users often do not know what and how to ask. The expectations of interfaces with voice input vary between minimum and huge. The frustration potential is correspondingly high.

More complex conversational interfaces require in part high cognitive skills in the processing of the conversation. Most of the time artificial intelligence is not yet sufficient. Most users would not reuse the interface after a disappointing experience. Very simple conversational interfaces work well which don't need any special cognitive skills in the backend.

Interfaces with voice input are especially useful in situations where someone's hands are not free. Therefore any obstacles to opening the interface should preferably be kept at a minimum.

Swisscanto Invest product platform .  Publish fund information quickly & easily

Fund providers are required to publish all information on their funds for their investors online and as PDFs. As a result Swisscanto Invest by the ZÃ¼rcher Kantonalbank has to make thousands of documents available in four languages. We have developed the product platform Swisscanto Invest for this purpose. This platform compiles various document formats from different parties sorts the contained data augments it with additional information and presents it on the website. This makes it possible to publish legally required information quickly easily and independently.

The new product platform processes thousands of documents. This allows Swisscanto Invest by the

to publish all information on its funds that needs to be made public for investors in accordance with the law. The search function goes from the

searching various data sources. Users can quickly filter and sort results from over 2,000 funds.

The data for the platform is aggregated in the Zürcher Kantonalbank system and the documents are then delivered to Netcetera. The platform checks the files from various sources for errors missing data and differences from the previous files (approx. 20,000 references are processed in a couple of milliseconds). Errors are reported directly back to the responsible authorities at the Zürcher Kantonalbank. After a successful check the platform compiles the information appropriately in the four national languages and displays them in a user. friendly format on the platform. The system also presents additional information on the individual funds and associated publications.

Thomas Best product platform department head at the Zürcher Kantonalbank says:  The new solution is very user. friendly and stable. It simplifies the publication of the prepared fund information tremendously.

This platform has replaced an application that's been in use for over 10 years. At the same time we've linked the platform to the Zürcher Kantonalbank systems for stronger integration. The design was also adapted.

Mobile xR .  Whatever is missing is on the way

VR AR MR â€“ for many non. experts these terms are easy to confuse. Meanwhile another technological revolution is bearing down on us under the umbrella term of Extended Reality or xR. For mobile devices Virtual Augmented or Mixed Reality applications are already a reality in a variety of different forms. (Published in Swiss IT Magazine issue 01. 02)

In order to find your way around the world of Extended Reality it is well worth knowing the differences between each of the above terms although there is no clear. cut generally accepted differentiation. Virtual Reality (VR) refers to a world beyond the one that we can physically see; it is generated by a computer. In this case there is a clear separation between the two types of reality. The user is totally surrounded by this world and is meanwhile totally cut off from the real world. Depending on the application the user may be able to interact with the objects and events in the VR world.

Augmented Reality (AR) is a computer. generated extension of the real world using information and images. You can watch visible reality via a smartphone (more rarely at present using AR glasses and headsets) while the device recognizes an object you are looking at in the real world (for example a historic building) and displays some text about it. To do this mobile devices need to be equipped with a good camera movement sensors and a powerful CPU. Finally Mixed Reality (MR) is a stronger version of AR. In this the physical reality is further merged with the virtual (VR) Reality. The user can embed computer. generated items in real surroundings walk around them and manipulate them interactively. VR AR and MR are referred to jointly under the umbrella term of Extended Reality (xR). Mobile xR is the term for its implementation on smartphones and tablets. These devices are already widely available and this allows mobile xR applications to spread rapidly. For effective Mixed Reality applications headsets or glasses are better (such as Microsoft's Hololens Google Glass or Magic Leap One).

1982: Damien Broderick referred to  Virtual Reality  for the first time in his science fiction novel

. And 35 years on? In an edition of the Swiss weekly  Schweiz am Wochenende  in December 2017 the Silicon Valley correspondent called virtual reality a  missed revolution.  Obviously the initial euphoria has evaporated. Not because the technology has basically failed to deliver but because everything is moving a lot faster and the VR glasses it requires are still relatively cumbersome. Augmented and Mixed Reality which build on it have already left pure virtual Reality behind. Nevertheless the sector is still made fun off. People claim that it is  playing around  rather than serious research and development.

All areas of Extended Reality are based to put it simply on technologies that are not so very new. 3D data and game engines. Virtual Reality is also mainly at home in computer games. This is where digital interaction between humans and computers occurs. In Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality in addition to the human and the computer it is the surroundings or the real world that join in as a third dimension. With AR you are for the main part still moving in a two. dimensional area because the mobile devices used to display it have traditional 2D screens.

Many people still remember the Peakfinder app from 2010 a unique very expensive pioneer in the  Stone Age  of AR. Today's mobile devices are already equipped with much more highly developed basic frameworks like ARKit or ARCore from Apple or Google. They form the basis and shorten the path to totally new mobile apps as you can use them to develop faster and cheaper applications. An example is the Ikea Place furniture catalog for the iPhone and iPad. While the camera shows your own living room you can choose a virtual armchair from the catalog and add it to the image so you can judge for yourself whether the size and color will fit with the place you have in mind. ARKit still has its shortcomings – for example recognition of surfaces in the room does not always work well. Space recognition and positioning still needs to be noticeably more precise. Nevertheless Apple has got ahead of the pack in the mobile xR world. Android has good technical AR frameworks but these are not as widely available as on iOS and Google will need to make a huge effort to catch up.

The descriptions of the following research and pilot projects are simplified and they are representative of thousands of similar prototypes worldwide. Medical students will in future learn human anatomy from a virtual patient lying on the table in front of them with the organs and body parts labeled on the screen. This reduces the cognitive burden of understanding the 3D representation. That allows them to focus on the functions instead of the interpretation of 2D images. This means faster learning and better quality learning. Overall the technology opens up completely new options in education. Students do not all have to be in the same place. For example they can see a virtual object in front of them on a table which they can turn and open following the teacher's instructions. For the maintenance of railway carriages technicians can for example walk round the carriage while the AR application shows them the items to be inspected in their current condition and what they should look like stores the history and even generates a paperless invoice Or to carry out a repair they can connect live to a colleague at headquarters who is an expert and can show them the procedure on their tablet. This improves the quality of maintenance and the cost effectiveness of the maintenance assignment. Finally an apartment purchaser can have the interior decorator show them what the finished kitchen could look like while they are standing in the shell of the building by pointing a tablet at the relevant location. As part of a pilot project with the Swiss railways (SBB) you can already take a virtual walk on your smartphone through the main station in Zurich. The list of the many other opportunities for tourism marketing media and entertainment is well beyond the scope of this article.

Visualization of what an old ship looked like with the HoloLens

Although xR glasses could certainly be improved in many ways the question is not whether they will come but when. They are particularly suitable for MR applications while Augmented Reality as we already mentioned is more at home on mobile phones and tablets. For solution providers what will make or break them will be how they generally deal with the topic of xR. From the point of view of software and content the companies most likely to succeed in the long term are those that understand the whole gamut of Extended Reality as a continuum and perhaps even adopt it as their core identity – unlike those that focus on a fixed point in this continuum. Especially in the business world there is huge potential for xR as the example applications described above demonstrate. Although specific applications are already on the market there is still a need for improvement in both hardware and software – for example comfortable glasses field of view voice recognition eye tracking gesture control and performance. But just sitting back and waiting is not the right approach. You can already deduce from today's xR glasses how they will work in future prepare for it and gain some important insights.

Like any technology revolution Extended Reality brings opportunities and risks. One thing is certain: the boundaries between what we know physically and virtual reality will disappear one day. It will no longer be  either/or ; we will transition seamlessly between the real world and the computer generated world. One day children will also play discover and be amazed in Mixed Reality. At the Game Technology Center of the Zurich Federal Institute of Technology a team led by Bob Sumner is researching Augmented Creativity. Figures in painting books come to life and visits to the Art Museum become a creative game for children rather than a boring duty. How will we learn to handle all this? Will we still be able to distinguish the real world from the artificial one? How will it affect our memories: what was real and what was not? Mobile phones could become obsolete in the not. too. distant future. We will develop services that we cannot even imagine today and use them via mobile xR. With so much uncertainty and so many new things getting advice from experts is becoming more and more important. Because as so often the question will be whether all these possibilities are actually useful.

The Hirslanden Group comprises a total of 17 clinics in 11 cantons. Over 2,000 inpatient doctors use the infrastructure of the Hirslanden clinics for their medical services. An intensive document exchange is taking place between the inpatient doctors their referring physicians and the clinics. Previously this exchange was not at all seamless as it used various often paper. based channels. Accordingly there was much room for improvement.

In 2014 the Hirslanden Group thus decided to commission a networking solution to connect clinics inpatient doctors and referring physicians.

In close collaboration with the Hirslanden Group Netcetera the i. engineers and Visionary created a solution based on the following goals:

Establishing an electronic solution for recording transmitting and integrating surgery birth and radiology registrations

Continuous electronic handling of processes from physicians' primary systems into clinic systems and back again with significant increases in quality and fewer inquiries

Convenient operation of docbox forms with and without interfacing with the software systems in medical offices

Simple. as. possible on. boarding of inpatient doctors and their software systems

docbox by Visionary connects inpatient doctors and their referring physicians with the clinics. Health engine is responsible for the clinics' internal workflows. Both products have a variety of interfaces for seamless integration into both primary and clinic systems. Digital data transfer reduces the amount of transcription work and automates routine tasks thus increasing process quality and efficiency. The solution supports physicians assistance personnel and patient administration employees with high. grade user. friendly functions (such as integrated ICD. 10 diagnostic and treatment catalogs exam routines templates etc.).

The following processes are already available in this system:

Other functions are being implemented continuously. Currently in the works:

All implemented functions optimally cover the additional requirements of an inpatient doctor system.

A consortium consisting of three partner firms successfully executed the order. It integrated both the health engine and docbox products.

Consulting and implementation of workflows as well as networking of the clinical applications (e.g. SAP HIS MCC archive systems D3 and Synedra MPI) with the product health engine.

Consulting and provision of software  as a service  with interfaces with health engine and inpatient doctors' and referring physicians' practice software systems using the docbox product.

First the solution was implemented in the Hirslanden Aarau clinic and several other Hirslanden clinics. The solution is so successful that in summer 2017 Hirslanden Group management decided to position it as strategically crucial and roll it out Group. wide.

With this solution and the end. to. end processes it can help to realize the Hirslanden Group is a leader in electronic networking in Switzerland. The solution is proven to achieve increases in efficiency when processing inpatient and outpatient registrations.

In addition to the digital solution other important success factors are: the standardized process of connecting the inpatient doctors' primary systems and above all the outstanding and close collaboration between the clinics Hirslanden's ICT & Processes division and the three suppliers Netcetera the i. engineers and Visionary.

The chances of open banking .  Presentation by Peter Zuber at Open Banking Forum

At the Open Banking Forum in March in ZÃ¼rich Peter Zuber our Managing Director Financial Technology talked about the chances of open banking.

The democratization of data forces incumbents to make proprietary data available to anyone with the owner‘s permission to access it. Open banking is being pushed into the mainstream by four main trends: Regulation enabling technology competition and consumer demand. Our expert answers the questions on how the banks are responding and their strategies and on why customers care. Many banks successfully started initiatives already. Banks actively driving open banking will be better positioned to maintain and extend their dominance.

Augment IT by Netcetera and MÃ¼ller Technologie AG in Frauenfeld have successfully tested the use of augmented and mixed reality for maintenance. Digitalizing the checklist helps maintenance personnel perform work of the same quality with less training and experience. Furthermore data can be collected for the traceability of maintenance work.

in Switzerland develops builds and maintains machines for modern railway and track construction. It is the only company in Switzerland to offer silo freight wagon cleaning and maintenance in accordance with GHP standards.

The following video shows how a maintenance employee sets a reference point after identifying the freight wagon and starts to run through a checklist of typically 50 to 100 checkpoints. The worker is guided to the individual checkpoints by means of navigation support and in this way carries out the process. Contextual information (text image video 3D and web content) is displayed in the correct place thus supporting the employee while they work.

This showcase has demonstrated that an augmented reality checklist enables employees with less training to perform the same tasks as their more experienced colleagues.

The high level of accuracy of the solution is particularly noteworthy – even in an industrial environment with freight wagons 25 meters in length which you repeatedly have to walk around the accuracy of the checkpoints is still very good. Furthermore no fixed installation or infrastructure is required and creating new checklists or modifying the existing checklist can be done quickly and easily.

checklist is currently running on Microsoft HoloLens and the Android ZenFone AR phone. Additional devices will be added soon.

Digital revolution in everyday working life .  AR and CI Workshop in Liechtenstein

What is still in its infancy today is already revolutionizing the working world of tomorrow: At a workshop of the Digital Liechtenstein initiative we demonstrated how augmented reality and conversational interfaces are pushing into the business world.

Pokemon Go an Augmented Reality. based smartphone game launched in the summer of 2016 thrilled the crowds. Players all over the world were drawn outdoors to hunt monsters with their smartphone camera. The possibility of merging the real and virtual worlds holds enormous potential not only for game developers .  the technology is already pushing into the everyday lives of many people. Today hardly any car is built without a head. up display that shows the most important driving data directly in the driver's field of vision. We are convinced that the technology will also shape many people's everyday working lives in the near future. At a workshop held in the context of the

at the Technopark in Vaduz our experts demonstrated how virtual reality headsets like the HoloLens can already be used to make the maintenance of railway cars more efficient how complex industrial machines can be projected into training rooms as virtual 3D models for training purposes or how doctors can be supported in the preparation of difficult operations. Through the various examples the approximately 70 workshop participants gained an exciting insight into the many possible applications of the new technology and were able to convince themselves of its practical suitability during the break with one of the HoloLenses on their heads.

Whether Siri Alexa or Google Home companies have been experimenting with artificial intelligence and the new man. machine interface Conversational Interfaces for several years. In the second part of the workshop our experts showed what it means when machines learn to communicate directly with customers without a screen. With voice. controlled artificial intelligence for example shop visits can be carried out entirely online timetable queries and ticket purchases can be made or automatic logs of consultations can be generated which not only save an immense amount of time but also help to ensure quality.

Whether Augmented Reality or Conversational Interfaces: The workshop impressively illustrated to the participants which new possibilities technological progress generates and provided inspiration to think about new business possibilities for one’s own company.

Full transparency in the operating room .  Article about VR/AR possibilities and definitions

Virtual (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) is no longer a dream of the future but is already changing the working world today. In addition to industrial manufacturing architecture and traffic on the road VR and AR applications are also used in medicine. (Published in e. commerce. magazin issue 02/2018)

The EKG chirps along periodically while the heart monitor shows the current oxygen saturation and blood pressure levels. The clear fluid drips soundlessly through the slender tube. The anesthesiologist checks the patient's condition on the surgical table. Meanwhile surgical specialist Dr. Brinkmann puts a HoloLens on over his head and downloads the latest CAT scan data. An atmosphere of quiet concentration permeates the room. Dr. Brinkmann projects the three. dimensional hologram of the brain directly onto the patient's head and walks back and forth in front of him.

In front of his eyes he sees virtually right into the patient's head with the spot where the procedure will be performed marked in red. The surgical nurse hands the drill to the surgeon and the HoloLens now shows him the exact angle and depth of the hole to be drilled directly into the patient's head. With the aid of this virtual marker Dr. Brinkmann places the drill in the precise location on the skull. The device hums softly. The year is 2025 and Augmented Reality  has been used successfully in surgery for some time now.

What might sound very futuristic is just one of the scenarios that the neurosurgery department of the Swiss Hospital Inselspital in Bern is working toward. Surgeons are already using the HoloLens prior to surgery to visualize and prepare for a surgical procedure. Several years of development are still needed before a HoloLens can actually be used during surgery.

The surgeon sees virtually right into the patient's head

Let's take a look at the current state of the technology. Airline pilots have known it for dozens of years as the  Head. Up Display  or HUD which projects additional or expanded information directly onto the windshield. Today this type of HUD is yet standard equipment in many cars. Information like the speed and directions from the navigation system are displayed directly in the driver's field of vision so as not to divert their gaze (thus the name because the head stays up). The information is virtually embedded directly into the environment. A navigation arrow appears to be lying directly on the road a safe distance bar tells the driver how much distance to maintain from the car in front of them.

Over the last few years a number of devices have come on the market that have at times brought new terminology with them. Even the software development is moving along rapidly: Development environments like  Unity  allow for very fast testing and developing of solutions with three. dimensional objects. Apple and Google are integrating Augmented Reality platforms into their operating systems. As a result today almost everyone has an AR. capable device in their pocket: the smartphone. Accordingly the most work is currently being done here. VR and AR applications are popping up everywhere like weeds. Well. known example: Ikea. With the new AR apps the customer of the Swedish furniture manufacturer can see how that sofa will look in their living room before buying it hikers can recognize every mountain peak with AR apps and children convert their drawings into 3D figures or hide virtual treasures in the real nursery.

But what are the actual differences between AR VR and MR?

Let's start with Virtual Reality. As the name implies VR applications transport you to a different world. You are literally immersed in the Virtual Reality which is also called  immersive reality  or even  total immersion .

In order to plunge in to such a world you use VR glasses. The term  glasses  can lead to some confusion though: You don't actually look through them but instead you have a small screen in front of your eyes that projects a unique world. In so doing a stereoscopic view can be achieved that suggests a three. dimensional depth. Only very limited interaction with the space takes place though. One of the bigger technical limitations for all VR glasses is the somewhat poor resolution on the screen for the intended use.hen you look through the lenses at a very close screen the pixels are visible.

By contrast enhanced reality – Augmented Reality – is not immersive. The real world is super. imposed with additional information. If you use a smartphone as an AR device the real space is captured by the camera and displayed on the screen. The additional information is then embedded in it. The best known example of an AR application may be the game  Pokémon Go . The  Google Glass  presumed dead is also an AR device and is still manufactured in an enterprise version. Since hands are not free when using the telephone it is the applications capable of conveying content that are most useful in daily work environments.

When Microsoft launched the HoloLens they connected their device with another term: Mixed Reality. The reality is no longer simply enhanced the Virtual Reality is mixed with reality or fused. You see the room with your own eyes while looking through glasses in which three. dimensional objects are displayed as holograms. Unlike conventional AR displays this relieves the cognitive load or mental effort generally required of the user to imagine the 3D object. In addition to Microsoft's HoloLens there are currently two other devices worth mentioning: the Meta 2 and the Magic Leap One from companies with the same names. Unlike the HoloLens neither are complete computers but instead require additional hardware connected with cables. What they have in common is a Head. Mounted Display (HMD). In the enterprise area these AR. HMDs currently offer the most opportunities.

Areas of application for VR include not only the entertainment industry (games videos etc.) but also architecture (virtual tour of a house) medical rehabilitation and therapies (training after a stroke or phobia therapy) or an actual roller coaster ride in artificial reality. A Swiss bank even launched a VR trading app with which you can trade real shares in a virtual space.

The exciting areas of application for AR and MR include architecture and product design: Plaster and wooden models are a thing of the past. Prototypes no longer need to be elaborately constructed but instead are loaded directly from the CAD program to the AR application so virtually teletransported.

Even maintenance work and training on machines are experiencing a developmental boost with AR. A Swiss company checks the simplification of the maintenance process for their rail cars by using a digitalized AR checklist. A short trip through time in the maintenance building demonstrates the application. With a screeching crash a silo rail car is driven into the building. It smells like machine oil and metal. The on. site service employee looks at the rail car with the HoloLens; in the blink of an eye it recognizes the model and required maintenance steps. The task: Check and when necessary repair all important parts like valves connectors brakes hoses ladders etc. The employee now sees what needs to be done with which tools on each car displayed right on the car directly at the corresponding location and they can also watch a help video or request assistance from a specialist. Hands are kept free at all times. The condition of the part to be checked is projected as an overlay showing the target condition. The first valve is checked and is fine the technician tells the HoloLens: Intake valve front OK at which point it acknowledges this and then directs him to the next item in the car to be checked by means of the navigation arrow. Once all checks are performed the task is automatically ended the dispatcher sees this on his screen and billing is triggered.

Yet in a few months this process will be reality. It will then be significantly easier to perform maintenance on such silo cars. A specialist becomes a generalist and can handle several tasks. The fact that a process with a paper printout and scan is thus digitalized and media discontinuities eliminated is a pleasant side effect.

There is additional potential in the area of Emotional Sales. How do I effectively sell an industrial machine without the need to transport it? Thanks to AR an entire system can be projected at a trade show or directly in the customer's building. As mentioned at the start medicine is one of the most exciting fields. Currently the use is restricted primarily to training. It can however be assumed that surgical preparations will not merely be prepared with AR in the future but rather with the assistance of MR.

Apps like  Pokémon Go . show that AR apps already reached the masses. It's hard to predict exactly when AR wil be established in the B2B sector. Gartner for example assumes that it will take another 5 to 10 years for AR to reach the plateau of productivity. We are much more optimistic here! The first productive projects will probably be delivered this year.

Simplifying mobile contactless payment .  Using biometrics to pay with smartphone

We have implemented one of the first independent solutions for contactless payment in Switzerland. It offers card issuers the opportunity to supplement their own apps with a globally standardized and certified mobile payment module. Thanks to biometrics customers pay simply quickly and securely with their smartphones. The solution is based on our product ToPay Cloud Payment and is just as convenient as the mobile payment offers of the smartphone manufacturers.

In Swiss retail you can pay at around 85,000 terminals via NFC (Near Field Communication) and 40% of consumers already use this option today via contactless card. The further development towards mobile payment with smartphones or wearables is accelerating this trend. Netcetera's digital payment solution ToPay Cloud Payment enables users to pay worldwide and at all common terminals with the Android smartphone. For customers it is simple safe and extremely fast. They pay at the checkout via NFC by holding their smartphone to the terminal and authenticating themselves with fingerprint. It is no longer necessary to enter a PIN at the terminal.

Netcetera sets new standards in user. friendliness for payment with Issuer and Bank apps. The use of biometrics enables fingerprint authentication and payment is as convenient as with the mobile payment offers of smartphone manufacturers. The big advantage: the solution is independent and can be integrated into existing apps for rapid customer acceptance.

Netcetera offers a Mobile Payment Module for all card issuers based on internationally recognized credit and debit card standards. This simplifies the implementation of a digital payment solution for banks and merchants because they can integrate this module efficiently into their own mobile banking apps and  bank pays . The customer pays with the familiar app of their bank or credit card provider. In addition the bank retains the interface to the customer and can thus reach them with further payment services.

one of Switzerland's largest payment card issuers is the first card issuer to integrate the payment module directly into its existing VisecaOne app. Viseca customers of Freiburger Kantonalbank and Bancque Cantonale du Jura now have access to the mobile payment functions.

Contactless payment with the smartphone is particularly secure is subject to the high requirements of credit card providers and continuously audited by external certification companies. In the ToPay Cloud Payment Module a token replaces the credit card data and is made available to the app. This means that no data comes into the hands of uncontrollable third party providers. It always remains in the sovereignty of the issuer or the bank.

Netcetera offers this solution for card issuers worldwide. In Switzerland

is the distributor. SwissWallet is a joint venture of the Aduno Group Netcetera and Swisscard with the aim of introducing digital payment solutions in Switzerland. More than 800,000 wallets are currently available for purchase on the platform.

News Apps for NZZ regional media .  Now also for 'Luzerner Zeitung' and 'St. Galler Tagblatt'

Now also for  Luzerner Zeitung  and  St. Galler Tagblatt

We have developed the new news apps for the NZZ regional media  Luzerner Zeitung  and  St. Galler Tagblatt . They are based on the proven NZZ News App that we developed together with the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung in 2017.

The mobile applications developed by us for the regional media  Luzerner Zeitung  and  St. Galler Tagblatt  are available in the App Stores for iOS and Android devices. They offer a classic home page with article view and an overview with local news. In the  My LZ  and  My Tagblatt  areas registered users can access additional functions such as a watch list for storing articles in their personal account or a history of the articles read. Registering brings further advantages for example readers with a personal user account can also save the choice of their region.

We implemented the apps with ReactNative a cross. platform mobile development technology. The apps are based on the popular NZZ News App,

Augmented Reality makes underground spaces visible .  Augment IT supports Future Cities Laboratory (FCL)

'   We have contributed our Augmented Reality expertise to Future Cities Laboratoryâ€™s Digital Underground showcase presented at the Urban Lab exhibition 'Underground: Singapore's Next Frontier' organized by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).  

The Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) was established by ETH. Zurich and Singapore’s National Research Foundation (NRF) and operates under the auspices of the Singapore. ETH Centre.

a collaboration between Singapore. ETH Centre Singapore Land Authority and the Geomatics Unit of the City of Zurich, aims to develop a roadmap for the 3D mapping of existing and future utility networks in Singapore.

Visitors experience seeing the unseen by using an app running on an iPad. Existing and future utility networks in Singapore are mapped in 3D. An accurate 3D digital map of the utility network and underground components will help planners to understand these dense and complex networks. Such a digital map could also shed light on the management of the utility networks such as their ownership and operation in order to ensure legal compliance efficiency and resilience of these systems.

The exhibition 'Underground: Singapore's Next Frontier’ at the URA Gallery was

by the Minister for National Development Mr Lawrence Wong on 30 May and is open to the public until 29 June 2018.

The great potential of Augmented Reality for underground structures

The use of underground space has largely been developed on a first. come. first. served basis. Over time this hinders further expansion and optimal use of underground space. By planning and safeguarding the space upfront and with the help of technology the potential of underground space can be unlocked and it can be used more efficiently.

When digging up streets or excavating construction pits for maintenance purposes there is often significant damage to power supply or telecommunications lines due to insufficient position information. Retrieving information about underground utilities and locating utility networks underground would be of great help to planners engineers and architects as well as field. workers. Imagine yourself: viewing energy and drainage lines in real. time thereby saving cost and time. Wouldn’t this be an asset?

In. house public transport ticketing .  Eco. friendly travel from headquarters to remote locations

On behalf of F. Hoffmann. La Roche AG we developed the public transport ticket system  Roche Mobility . The solution is free of charge for their employees and replaces the company\'s own bus service. Employees can now obtain a digital public transport ticket on their intranet in the Mobility Web Shop.

has provided its employees with their own shuttle service for travel between individual company locations in Basel. As part of ongoing site development they replaced this at the end of March 2018 with an eco. friendly solution that is still free of charge for employees. The  Roche Mobility  public transport ticket system developed by us makes this possible.

The employee chooses the travel route between the locations within the city of Basel in the web shop. The web shop then obtains a code from the promotion toolbox via a web service interface and makes it available to the employee as a QR code. The employee scans the QR code with the

. The digital public transport ticket is now ready in the app and only needs to be validated before the start of the journey the same as with the popular multi. trip card.

Individual solution .  commercially attractive and quickly implemented

We built the web shop as an individual solution for Roche. It is based on the Promotion Toolbox an existing component of the Wemlin Suite. With the Wemlin Suite we offer a comprehensive range of products for public transport such as the

app departures for display boards or the public transport database

Julian Hennig Project Manager Mobility at F. Hoffmann. La Roche AG comments on the public transport ticket system:  The ticket system is an excellent solution for making the very well. developed public transport system in Basel available to our employees. The ease of use and the paperless tickets are very popular with us!

Netcetera contributes to development of new internet payment standards

The digital payment specialist Netcetera has extended its membership in EMVCo .  the technical standardization body of leading credit card schemes .  to the  Technical Associate  status. The company\'s experts are thus actively influencing the standardization of secure payment solutions in the e. commerce environment in particular the EMVÂ® Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) specification that is currently being developed. This new standard will make internet payment by credit and debit card significantly easier and more secure at the same time. Netcetera also offers this knowledge to PSPs merchants and card issuers in the form of training courses.

As a  Technical Associate  member of the international standardization committee

Netcetera works together with the EMVCo working group for EMV® Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) on technical and operational issues.

Today entering credit card information on merchant websites still involves high drop. out rates as customers find it too cumbersome to re. enter their card and customer data over and over again especially on mobile devices. The new Secure Remote Commerce standard is designed to provide a consistent and convenient customer experience for remote payments across all schemes. As Netcetera already offers e. commerce checkout and wallet solutions for millions of credit cards and has practical experience with their operation the payment specialist is contributing valuable expertise to the development of the next generation of internet payment.

We have a leading position at 3. D Secure 2.0 and are pleased to be able to contribute our exclusive knowledge in the area of digital payment. Partners who work with us benefit from early access to developments and standardization in this area via Netcetera. This enables merchants to integrate relevant components into their online shop or mobile app in good time,  says Dr. Thomas Fromherz Chief Strategy Officer Payments at Netcetera.

EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce framework defines the roles superordinate processes and data descriptions that enable a consistent and secure exchange of card data within the remote commerce environment. The technical framework document will soon be followed by the publication of a detailed specification defining the protocol and core functions.

Netcetera as technical partner of EMVCo and innovative technology provider in the digital payment industry has already gained a deep understanding of the upcoming new secure e. commerce payment solution which is supported by all card systems and passes this knowledge on to its customers and other members of the payment security industry.

In half. day workshops Netcetera experts answer key questions about the new protocol for example: What is EMV Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) and how does it affect your business? Participants will also learn about the checkout procedures for SRC support. Netcetera will also explain topics such as the importance of tokenization for SRC the integration of 3. D Secure 2.0 into the SRC flow or the consequences of SRC for existing online Scheme wallets. In a live demonstration of possible SRC checkout processes Netcetera will show how SRC will look like.

The workshops take place in Zurich Vienna Berlin Frankfurt London Milan and Munich at the end of the year.

A glimpse behind the scenes of Jazoon TechDays 2018 in Bern .  Interview with our Software Engineer Alex Striffeler

A glimpse behind the scenes of Jazoon TechDays 2018 in Bern

'   Soon it's time again: On September 6 and 7 the Swiss software community will meet at the Jazoon TechDays 2018 on the Gurten near Bern. This year's event is all about Cloud Containers and Continuous Everything.

Alexander Striffeler one of our Software Engineers in Bern is a member of the organizing committee and is determined to make the Jazoon TechDays a unique experience again this year. He gives some insights and views on the event.

The interview was executed by Camille Schwarzentruber von AdNovum and was published on 27 July 2018 on

Camille Schwarzengruber AdNovum: The Jazoon TechDays 2018 will focus on DevOps for Devs – Cloud Containers and Continuous Everything. Can you tell us a little more about that?

Alexander Striffeler Netcetera:  DevOps  is a combination of technology methodology and corporate culture. All this makes it possible to develop software projects quickly and to deliver them regularly in small steps. From my own experience and conversations with other software developers I know that this topic is relevant to many companies and poses great challenges. This is why we are convinced that with  DevOps  we have our fingers on the pulse of the times.

How do you succeed in finding exciting topics for the conference again and again?

Two aspects are crucial here: Firstly the organizers of the Jazoon TechDays are software developers themselves. Secondly the composition of the organizing committee changes regularly which means that new interests and ideas are incorporated each time.

You engage high. profile speakers every year. Can you already provide a few names and maybe even some of the topics they will cover?

Amongst our speakers will be for example Aaron Blohowiak of Netflix Kief Morris of ThoughtWorks and Charity Majors founder of honeycomb.io and former employee of Facebook. To get an overview of the different topics presented I recommend having a look at http://jazoon.com/agenda.

One of my personal highlights is the workshop with Russ Miles of ChaosIQ entitled  Successful Production Microservices .

There is also the backstage track which allows the participants to talk with the speakers about their very individual questions in a relaxed lounge atmosphere.

Machine Learning powered risk classification to detect waste abuse and fraud in health insurance claims

Machine Learning and more generally Artificial Intelligence are again at the peak of expectations. The availability of large amounts of data and affordable computing power helps spur new research that contributes to the increased interest in this field. Between all the hype around super intelligent computers that may outsmart humanity we are daily witnessing the emergence of new practical tools. These tools focus on a specific domain and address a limited problem.

Machine Learning (ML) is a computer science field that enables computer systems to learn by automatically building statistical models with the use of available data. Instead of following static program instructions ML algorithms learn from the data to identify patterns discover knowledge and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

ML is part of the broader field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Other areas of AI frequently intertwine with ML such as Knowledge Reasoning Natural Language Processing and Artificial General Intelligence. Recently we have been witnessing a wave of new products and services built within several AI spaces. Many of these initiatives have been under a strong backlash as they failed to meet expectations. However we can also see the usefulness of ML algorithms when applied to a specific limited problem such as detecting an anomaly in business transactions.

Healthcare insurance and the issue of waste abuse and fraud

Healthcare insurance is a multifaceted industry that brings together care providers insurance companies and patients. As the industry is expected to create social benefits there is constant pressure to contain costs while providing security and improving the health of the general population.

Misuse of the health insurance is an ongoing issue. Motivated by the financial incentives different stakeholders are creating waste abuse the market or even commit fraud. The volume of waste abuse and fraud (WAF) is estimated to be in the range of 5. 10% of the yearly healthcare expenditure. This makes WAF a significant contributor to the medical inflation. Insurance claims are under continuous scrutiny by the healthcare payers for being one of the key tools to control healthcare spending.

Looking from an insurance perspective WAF is being generated by both healthcare providers and insured members. In the worst cases a conspiracy. type of fraud involves several parties colluding in the misuse. When looking at the complexity levels we can categorize WAF in seven levels. This starts with single transaction as the simplest one and goes up all the way to multiparty criminal conspiracies.

The most prevalent types of fraud carried out by policy holders are: gaining access to or being reimbursed for services typically not covered by the policy. For clinicians and healthcare providers financial gain is the main motivation with up. coding service unbundling and billing for unnecessary or even not rendered services.

Insurance companies are already applying rule. based systems to detect WAF in insurance claims. These systems are very similar to other fraud prevention systems for financial transactions e.g. credit card transactions where the system checks the validity of a transaction against a predefined set of business rules. These business rules require continuous management. Even then they are only useful as long as the person managing the rules can create a comprehensive mental model for the complete rule set.

This is where ML fits in perfectly and elegantly solves a complex problem. Once the ML models have been trained with historical transactions they can quantify the anomaly of each new transaction compared to the history and assign potential risk to it. Furthermore ML models adapt as the system processes new transactions. Which means they are improving while operating and manual rule management is no longer needed.

One important distinguishing factor is the ability of the ML algorithms to learn from the judgments of the human claim processors. Typical rule. based systems have a set of predefined medical rules that determine if a treatment should be approved for a given medical condition. However claim processors make their decisions using additional information such as understanding of the specific care provider or history of the insured member. They also have additional information from outside the claim system or even make professional judgments based on their medical experience. ML models trained with these decisions will adapt their risk prediction based on the judgment made by the processor. They are implicitly implementing rules that are not only medical but arise from the daily practice.

) ML based system that quantifies the WAF risk of insurance claims. Following is the high. level overview of the approach.

Healthcare claims contain cleanly structured data elements that can be used as input for ML model training. These elements include information about the insured member with their medical condition the medical procedures and services performed on the patient the prescribed medications time date and location of the services and others.

One representation of the problem space for waste abuse and fraud in health insurance could be the multi. layer graph representation. Each data element in the transaction can be represented by one or more nodes in the graph. Nodes are linked to one or more of the other nodes from the same or from a different type. Each edge in the graph has an assigned weight based on the relationship of the specific nodes. After determining the nodes and edges of the initial graph additional layers can be added that represent different abstractions for the transactions. Once the problem is defined in this way one should represent the nodes and edges using descriptive attributes and start the learning process of the ML approach.

This iterative process of knowledge discovery uses a combination of different data analysis and visualizations. Conveying the information and the gained knowledge to an individual during the analysis even when working with highly skilled actuaries is one of the key tasks. Therefore good data visualization is just as important as the data analysis.

Defining the baseline in behavior analysis mandates proper analysis and definition of peer groups first. For example pharmaceutical transactions (eRX or PBM) have very different features than inpatient visits (hospital stay). Depending on the transaction types this classification can be straightforward. In absence of the elements containing the required information however a data. driven approach should be applied. Aggregations on a clinician level is another case. Identifying the correct peer group for comparison is a critical step in the process. To address these kinds of problems we use unsupervised data. driven approaches that try to find hidden patterns in the data based on a similarity measure using unlabelled data.

The practical experience shows some interesting results when using an unsupervised approach for data analysis. For example insurance professionals insist that a similarity of claims has to be determined only by the medical condition mentioned in the transaction. However determining groups (clusters) of similar claims using the medical services can yield better precision in certain cases.

When the available data is unlabeled clusters and peer groups are being used for discovering and identifying some unusual behavior or anomalies in the population. These models assign risk score to the actual transactions by comparing them against pre. calculated baseline. Based on the risk appetite of the insurance company the models can accept variable thresholds for allowed variance.

If the available data is at least partially labeled supervised and semi. supervised data. driven approaches are most useful when assigning individual transactions to a pre. defined risk group. For this purpose we use multi. stage classifiers for making the final decision about the risk score of the transactions. The individual classifiers are based on state. of. the. art deep learning techniques ensembles of decision trees and lazy methods.

Further we use computationally efficient predictive models based on deep neural networks for building vector representation of medical procedures and services.  These models represent (embed) the medical procedures and services in a continuous vector space. Each dimension of the embedding represents a latent feature of the medical procedure or the service capturing useful semantic relations between them. These models are very successful in detecting advanced anomalies in the transactions e.g. general practitioner billing services typically done by specialists. Additionally a wide range of handcrafted features are used for building predictive models for knowledge discovery and decision support.

In the final step the results are weighted based on the importance and model correlation factors to determine the final risk score.

The above explains the different steps involved in the process of the configuring ML models to detect WAF in insurance claims. These steps are necessary as they can make the difference between a general. purpose analytical system and actionable recommendation system used in on. demand claim processing.

For the claim processors that are acting based on the recommendation of the system it is critical to understand the cause and insight for each recommendation. However decomposing this information is not a trivial task. The complexity of the system especially when using a few thousand decision trees does not allow effortless interpretation of the results. A solution for this challenge is to shadow each of the steps in the above. mentioned processes by cause. and. insight model. The model tracks the decisions and gives a rationale behind a recommendation. This surely limits the level of details the system can provide. However even though prediction is important information in the decision making process it is not the only one. Humans are still better at making judgments.

Future trends ICT: Augmented Reality .  Expertenvortrag am Event von IAMCP

Virtuality finds its way into everyday life as augmented reality. Some examples were presented at the

Future Trends ICT Event in collaboration with swiss made software in Basel at the end of September. Entrepreneurs and experts shared their experiences. Benno Häfliger Director Digital Enterprise at Netcetera talked about  HoloLens in neurosurgery  and presented various applications that we implemented for our customers.

Why we invest in Augmented Reality .  Interview with our Head of AR

Inside. channels.ch spoke with our Head of AR Reto Grob about the development opportunities and risks of augmented reality.

Several market research companies estimate the global market for augmented reality solutions at EUR 24 billion or even as much as EUR 83 billion by 2021. This is despite the fact that the technology that combines virtual reality with the real environment is anything but hype – at least if you believe Gartner's analysts who put AR in the

trough of disillusionment  in the latest hype cycle

It is certainly a technology that could achieve greater market penetration in the coming years. In Switzerland people are working on AR applications as well. For example Netcetera invested in the sector early on and presently has a team of nine specialists working on augmented reality solutions in a dedicated department.

With the publication of the financial results for the last six months the Zurich. based software company stated that they are already noticing significant demand for AR. However up to now this demand has been limited to pilot projects for SBB the Bühler technology group railway & track construction specialist Müller Gleisbau the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne and Bern University Hospital.

During a background interview with inside. channels.ch at Netcetera's headquarters Reto Grob Head of AR at the software company asserted:  In the long term augmented reality is a major topic at Netcetera which is why we were one of the first Swiss companies to invest in this area and initiate specific projects. The demand is constantly growing.  The software architect who has been in charge of the department for 18 months now compares AR to mobile platforms. At the turn of the millennium they were still in their infancy but are now an indispensable part of every life.

Among other things we wanted to know how much Netcetera is investing in this technology and whether they are already making money from it. Furthermore we wanted to know what the evolution of the market looks like and what the major obstacles are for widespread use of AR in the business sector.

According to Grob they have made major investments in AR in the last two years and boosted their development resources. However the  godfather  of this division would not give any specific figures. Even so the scope of the investment can be roughly estimated based on the size of the department. The nine AR specialists work in Zurich and at the nearshoring location in Skopje (Macedonia) though some in other areas too.

According to Micaëla Raschle Grand who is responsible of the marketing and communications for the department the expenditure is justified by the order situation. However Netcetera is not tipping its hand on sales and profit figures.  We are close to the break. even point,  is all that AR head Grob has to say – and that they have a good outlook and plan for the next twelve to eighteen months.  We are heading towards a profitable situation.

Just recently they were able to book two more customers from the industrial sector. The main focus of Netcetera's AR department is the business sector. It can benefit from the technology for maintenance and quality control training courses and sales. Many companies are already carrying out pilot projects in this area but only a few applications are productive says Grob. These are not trivial apps by any means adds Raschle Grand. They are serious projects:  AR is used in particular to boost productivity.  The customer experience is good and they are receiving positive feedback the department's  story. teller  assures us.

At Netcetera they expect to see the most significant growth in industrial maintenance. By contrast the business cases for the health care and educational sectors where AR applications could certainly be worthwhile are more complex.  Here we are seeing relatively large obstacles with regard to regulations fundings and politics,  says Grob.

Grob is generally optimistic about the future.  I don't see any major risks or hurdles and the market is growing,  says the computer scientist with a degree from ETH. Netcetera's primary aim in 2017 was to create awareness in the entire ecosystem. This year the main focus is on specific applications.

However they do not have any influence on hardware development such as the AR glasses HoloLens or Magic Leap One both of which are used at Netcetera. Broader acceptance is currently hampered by difficulties such as the limited field of view and high cost.

However the glasses are important in the industrial sector because they leave both hands free for work unlike smartphones or tablets. Despite this Grob thinks that AR apps for normal smartphones and tablets will gain acceptance more rapidly over the next two years. Here as well Netcetera is in a good position. They have a large team of iOS and Android developers who can be deployed to develop mobile AR solutions.

A general hindrance at present is that  monetary validation of the use of AR  is still lacking among customers.  Although companies see the potential some budgets are still missing,  concludes Grob.  However I am confident that the number will increase significantly in the near future.

Netcetera is well equipped for this according to Raschle Grand. The Zurich. based software specialist has competition from ERP providers among others. For example SAP offers similar solutions under the Leonardo umbrella. When asked about this she points out that Netcetera's solutions are more specific and quicker to get up and running.  Our customers appreciate that they can test our solutions quickly and specifically in the business environment in order to gain experience for the next iteration,  says Raschle Grand.

The future of payment .  Our expertsâ€˜ insights at the Swiss Payment Forum

How is the digitalization of the payment industry progressing and what is driving the digital transformation of banks? Three of our payment experts have answers to these questions: They shared their knowledge at the Swiss Payment Forum in November 2018 the conference of the payment industry in Switzerland.

“Secure Remote Commerce – Is the credit card industry getting around the wallet bend with SRC?”

Apple/Google Pay versus Issuer Wallet? .  Fast and secure mobile payment experience with ToPay

Confronted with the potential loss of the traditional customer interface banks and issuers are currently facing the challenge of optimally playing the digital customer journey. Particularly relevant is the payment process itself which is increasingly digital and mobile and integrated into the daily interactions of consumers via the smartphone. Banks and issuers should therefore strive to maximize digital customer touchpoints in order to remain present in the brand perception of consumers.

With Netcetera's white label product  ToPay Mobile Wallet  issuers banks and other wallet providers can offer a fast and secure mobile payment experience while strengthening their customer relationships with valuable payment. related services. In addition to the integration of an issuer. controlled HCE tokenization solution (ToPay Cloud Payment) the product also offers in. app provisioning of cards for Google Pay and Apple Pay ( green path  activation with one click). Which of these solutions is to be preferred depends on many factors and should be systematically evaluated.

Gold for outstanding user experience .  Paraplegic app awarded at Digital Economy Award

Our prototype for an app for the prevention of pressure points makes everyday life easier for wheelchair users and paraplegics. We developed the prototype in a research project together with Swiss Paraplegic Research. At the Digital Economy Award in November 2018 the project won a gold certificate for its outstanding user experience.

Pressure sores are one of the most common complications in people with spinal paralysis. These bruises are extremely painful lengthy to treat and can result in expensive hospital treatment lasting several weeks. During rehabilitation those affected receive recommendations for the prevention of pressure sores but some of them implement them inadequately after leaving the hospital. As part of a study we developed a smartphone app that offers patients personalized support in preventing pressure sores.

The value of the app lies in the prevention and better treatment of developing skin pressure points. It enables users to behave correctly and helps them to monitor their skin condition. With a built. in messenger device they have the possibility to contact local and specialized health professionals in case a pressure spot should occur despite their efforts.

Our prototype is precisely tailored to the needs and limitations of the paraplegic target group and is unique in the world due to the direct secure and encrypted connection of healthcare professionals. None of the currently available apps in this sector offer such extensive functionality and none of the other apps offer integrated secure and privacy. compliant communication with healthcare professionals from the region.

in Zurich in November the jury honored the prototype with a Gold Certificate in the category  Highest Digital Quality . This award for the user experience and the design process is well deserved. The creation process is a prime example of the optimal involvement of users in the design process.

From day one we have permanently integrated the future users into the design process. This really helped us to understand their problems and to develop an app that is actually useful in everyday life. The design was refined in two iterations and tested with users from the target group at the end of each iteration. We observed the 20 users animated them to think aloud and then interviewed them. In addition a co. design session (design studio) with future users took place at the beginning of the design work.

A group of paraplegics has limited hand motor skills. We have discussed but rejected an enlargement of all buttons beyond the usual extent. For an optimal user guidance we used a Conversational User Interface. In addition to classic navigation a virtual coach can guide users through the contents and functions of the app. All main use cases are accessible via a classic menu navigation as well as via a voice interface.

Our UX Architect Adrian Heydecker presented the advantages of a conversational interface over a classic graphical user interface at the

at the beginning of November. Adrian led the entire design and usability process for the prototype.

The next step is to expand the concept and close gaps so that the prototype is ready for implementation.

Are you also interested in a perfect design process for your application? Our experts are happy to help you!

Netcetera and DKB simplify online credit card payment with biometrics .  Simplifying online credit card payment with biometrics

Netcetera and DKB simplify online credit card payment with biometrics

Drastically simplified registration process for online security procedures with app

The software company Netcetera market leader for 3. D Secure in the DACH region together with the Deutsche Kreditbank AG (DKB) has modernized the 3. D Secure process for its customers and integrated the payment approval via biometrics. One of the largest card issuers in Germany hereby integrates the registration and payment authorization for card payments into their banking app. The implemented security procedure complies with the payment directive PSD2 dictated by the EU from September 2019. DKB customers activate their credit cards in the app easily quickly and securely for their online purchases.

With an increase of 11.4 percent to EUR 65.10 billion gross sales of goods in e. commerce continued to grow at double. digit rates in 2018. Pure e. commerce sales thus account for more than every eighth euro in the retail sector. The online marketplaces also continued to grow strongly.

To do justice to this trend banks have to offer their customers a modern and carefree online shopping experience. With over 4 million cards Deutsche Kreditbank AG is one of the first major banks to offer a solution that allows cardholders to register directly for a security procedure in real time.

The jointly implemented registration process without media discontinuity and the very user. friendly 3. D Secure payment process using biometric approval ensure secure and simple purchases with significantly fewer payment interruptions.

confirms:  Together with Netcetera we have further developed our banking app so that we can provide our customers with an optimized user experience through biometric authentication. This feature is also consistent with our understanding of an advanced online direct bank and digitized processes .

The 3. D Secure process has been significantly simplified by integrating the functions of the previous DKB Card. Secure app into the banking app. This eliminates the need for a cumbersome card registration process with an identity code sent by post or one. cent bank transfer. This modernization simplifies the registration process enormously. The strong authentication of the cardholder in the banking app is now also used for the 3. D Secure functionality. There the user activates his card for 3. D Secure with a simple click and enters a TAN number for confirmation. In addition the support of biometrics simplifies the secure payment process. After the checkout in the online shop the sales details are presented to the user on the smartphone again.

He identifies himself in the banking app with the biometric function supported by the device (e.g. by fingerprint or Face ID) and then releases the payment quickly and easily with a click .  without having to enter a TAN number or password.

Peter Frick Managing Director Payment Security at Netcetera says:  Our implementation of the latest development in the 3. D Secure environment for DKB is a milestone for digital payment. DKB can thus offer the best possible user experience while at the same time ensuring a high level of security .

This progress in online payment traffic increases user. friendliness enormously. Banks and card issuers are thus making credit card payments in online retail more attractive for their customers again. In addition online shops increase their turnover thanks to fewer interruptions during the payment process. Both will lead to a further increase in the acceptance of credit cards and payments as well as payment by smartphone in Germany.

EMVCo approved: Android and iOS 3DS SDK .  Secure in. app commerce with higher transaction conversion

All our 3. D Secure products are EMVCo approved: Our Android and IOS 3DS SDK products have received the EMVCo Letter of Approval. Acquirers merchants and PSPs with iOS and Android apps can now use our product to enroll in the 3DS 2.0 platforms of all credit card schemes. Implementing the 3DS SDK component in the merchant app leads to a higher number of approved transactions and less shopping cart abandonments during the checkout process.

Online shopping from mobile devices has become daily standard routine. In Europe the Payment Services Directive PSD2 and the major worldwide schemes mandate all e. commerce transactions to be strongly authenticated and seamless. EMV 3. D Secure known as 3DS 2.0 standard own by

fulfills these requirements and reduces the transaction abandonment rate. Netcetera’s 3DS SDK iOS and Android products are among the first EMVCo approved 3DS SDK products worldwide listed with EMVCo for the 2.0 protocol. As an integral part of the shopping process the Netcetera 3DS SDK supports authentication and verification of the cardholder.

The 3DS SDK from Netcetera ensures the smooth and reliable processing of card payments from a native merchant app. Merchants can easily integrate the 3DS 2.0 SDK to ensure that their app both supports strong authentication and generates a larger number of transactions. They benefit from the liability shift to the card issuer and thereby reduce their risk for non. authenticated transactions associated refunds and lost revenue. The 3DS SDK provides easy integration of the merchant app with the 3DS platforms of card networks. From a consumer perspective the entire authentication process is handled within the app: seamless without distraction and redirects. Even if an additional authentication is required consumers will feel at home during the complete shopping process.

All our 3DS products are now EMVCo approved. The Netcetera ACS was one of the first to be certified for EMV 3DS. We also received the EMVCo Letter of Approval for our 3. D Secure Server as first in Europe and second in the World. Acquirers merchants and payment service providers can use our product to enroll in the 3DS 2.0 platforms of all credit card schemes. With the Netcetera 3. D Secure Issuer Service we were the first payment service provider worldwide to receive the Letter of Compliance for the Mastercard Identity Check program. In November 2018 we processed the world's first end. to. end EMV 3DS authenticated transaction with a Mastercard credit card via the Netcetera ACS. In January 2019 we won the Golden Transaction in the  Innovation  category for our outstanding and innovative payment solutions. As EMVCo Technical Associate Netcetera addresses new trends in payment early on and keeps its services and products up to date.

Why tokenization is essential .  Serving two interests at once: Security & scalability

On the security side tokenization helps lowering the risk of storing and processing card data: Once credit card numbers (PANs) are stolen the damage can be extremely expensive for the party that did not protect this payment card data well enough. In contrast if a token is compromised the funding PAN is not affected and therefore the plastic card does not need to be exchanged. Instead only the compromised token will be blocked.

The tokenization allows using payment on all kind of devices and channels. The distribution of a token and the binding to a dedicated use case allow scaling the operations.

Issuer Wallets X Pays mobile contactless solutions based on smartphones and wearables are today already based on tokenization using TSPs from the schemes (AETS MDES VTS etc.).

PSPs and merchants can benefit from tokenization as well. Card not present payments will increase the security by adding cryptograms in transactions. Also with scheme tokenization there is a connection from the merchant through the PSP via the TSP to the issuer.

This end to end connectivity has two main advantages:

The customer sees his real card picture and card details (like in X Pays)

Once the issuers updates or renews the card the assigned token holder (e.g. the merchant) will be notified. Today accepting recurring payments is a challenge as around 3% of the stored cards are ending their lifetime each month.

Typically merchants want to support all relevant schemes. This entails developing an interface to all major TSPs like AETS MDES VTS etc. Such a project with each scheme is costly and time consuming. Netcetera has done this integration work with the ToPay Cloud Payment solution already. Now we are extending this service to offer a unified and easy way of using scheme tokenization in e. commerce applications.

Netcetera offers standardized interfaces (API) to PSP and merchants to reduce complexity and accompanies the entire process of onboarding (MDES VTS AETS) with the schemes. We support the following main use cases:

Card data can be added manually or tokenized from card on file.

The card date (e.g. last 4 digits of funding PAN card product name card image) can be retrieved and shown to the consumer

Notification to keep card data up to date – once an issuer blocks or renews a card the merchant will be notified

Summarizing the advantages of scheme tokenization in e. Commerce payments we can confirm this is a big step forward:

Card holder sees where the card is enrolled their real card data and images

Merchants have direct connection to the card issuers and do not need to bother with expired cards

Netcetera combines this technology with our 3DS SDK and the 3DS Server to fulfill the requirements of PSD2 in combination with merchant tokenization.

3. D Secure solution with Credorax .  Leveraging Artificial Intelligence

Credorax the NextGen merchant acquiring bank has implemented our EMV 3DS certified acquiring products into its payment processing gateway. They added an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based optimization engine that analyses each transaction in real. time for the best business results. This early. market offering will assist merchants with their compliance requirements to card schemes and European regulations in the most seamless way possible ensuring high acceptance rates.

developed their latest solution “Smart 3D Secure” in partnership with us: it is built on top of our 3. D Secure acquiring products (MPI 3DS Server and 3DS SDK) which are EMVCo certified and compliant with major EMV 3. D Secure scheme programs. With this solution Netcetera and Credorax help merchants improve conversions optimise their checkout process reduce fraud and stay protected from fraudulent chargeback liability.

The transition to the new 3. D Secure 2.0 protocol is going into effect this year. Our EMV certified 3DS acquiring products comply with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) requirements for strong user authentication. As a result the “Smart 3D Secure” is also PSD2 compliant. Cerdorax’s “3D Secure Adviser” is an AI. based flexible decision layer that analyses each transaction in real time and decides on the best 3. D Secure routing including risk assessment and exemption management.

“New mandated processing requirements can be seen as a burden but they can also drive innovation. In this instance it inspired us to develop a solution for optimized usage of 3. D Secure facilitating frictionless customer authentication and smooth customer experiences,” said Moshe Selfin Chief Operations Officer and Chief Technology Officer at Credorax. “We are excited to partner with Netcetera to launch this NextGen solution which offers our merchants the added advantage of compliancy to the Strong Customer Authentication requirements in the upcoming Payment Services Directive 2.”

“We are excited to build on our strong relationship with Credorax a company that understands the evolutionary loops in tech and regulation and can react quickly to best serve their customers,” said Andrej Vckovski CEO of Netcetera. “We are proud to provide certified EMV 3. D Secure products on which Credorax has built their solution.”

Leading CONCORDIA into the digital future .  Secure and high. performance system integration

We have connected the standard software adcubum SYRIUS to various systems for the health and accident insurer CONCORDIA. In close cooperation we have created a high. performance and scalable Business Service Layer. This guarantees the secure exchange of master and transaction data with the customer portal and other applications.

Today's customers expect health insurance companies to offer an efficient digital service as well as personal support. Insurers are therefore required to offer secure and user needs. oriented applications. For an efficient process the customer portal requires access to customer information in the main system. The secure connection of the outside world to the internal application with the customer information has to be guaranteed. As one of the oldest health insurers in Switzerland and Liechtenstein,

takes the needs of its customers seriously. Data security and the protection of personal data are of paramount importance.

Netcetera solved this challenge for CONCORDIA: we connected the standard software adcubum SYRIUS with other applications via its API bridge. This secure system integration consists of the Business Service Layer which forms the interface from the main system to various other applications such as the digital counter or from the customer portal to the archive. High security requirements system coupling transformation of the different data scalability and high performance had to be met.

The Business Service Layer is one of the building blocks that advances CONCORDIA in its digital transformation. Stefan Pleisch CIO of CONCORDIA about the successful implementation:  Netcetera and CONCORDIA have complemented each other very well. Netcetera has used its expertise and experience to successfully complete a complex system integration. With it we have reached an important milestone on our path to digital transformation.

Such a close and good cooperation contributes a lot to the success of a project. Together we were able to develop the best solution for this step towards digitization,  confirms Gabriele Brechbühl Managing Director Digital Enterprise at Netcetera.

Path Coordination System for RailNetEurope .  Path Coordination System for RailNetEurope

Netcetera leading Swiss software company and global IT solutions innovator has implemented the new Path Coordination System (PCS) for RailNetEurope (RNE). RNE is a non. profit association that facilitates fast and easy access to the European rail network. The current project is rooted in the close collaboration that started in 2002 and went live in October 2019.

helps 650 users across 30 European countries coordinate rail transport scheduling. It is based on a centralised platform that takes into account the diversity and differences between the countries it serves. The platform builds on a collaboration that started with RailNetEurope in 2002 and Netcetera’s first solution “Pathfinder”. Cultural and organisational differences were taken into account to develop a successful solution. Its ability to share comprehensive timetabling information sparked a 20% reduction in planning and coordination efforts for European passenger and goods traffic.

Máté Bak Head of PCS at RNE said “We are very pleased to be able to rely on a strong technology partner such as Netcetera – a team that not only delivers innovation but also understands the complexity of international projects with different cultures and languages. With their support we have been able to deliver on our mandate of facilitating easy access to rail networks in Europe. Netcetera’s solution the Path Coordination System and the Pathfinder that preceded it make planning more efficient and coordination easier in a rail system that includes multiple partners spanning countries and regulatory regimes.”

PCS refines the shared scheduling platform by introducing the Empty Envelope Concept. The model addresses overlapping missing or doubled subsidiary timetables and helps partners better reconcile stations times operating days and other parameters. It ensures calendar consistency by avoiding overlapping days and creating more harmonisation at country borders. Other new features include new GUI elements time zone flexibility and the management of multiple pre. constructed catalogue paths (Pre. arranged Paths).

Patrik Auf der Mauer Director Digital Enterprise at Netcetera said “We are proud that RailNetEurope has been counting on us for over fifteen years. This unique technology. led collaboration helps to harmonise rail traffic across borders. Thanks to our close association with the RailNetEurope teams and their stakeholders we have been able to devise and deliver technological solutions that bring real. world benefits for Railway Undertakers Applicants Infrastructure Managers Allocation Bodies and Rail Freight Corridors and result in constant innovation and improvement.”

Berliner Zeitung with Swiss software .  Converting digital processes and technology in six weeks

It is all happening in a flash: the new owners of the Berliner publishing house have decided to radically modernize their editorial office. In just under four weeks they turned the production processes 180 degrees and implemented the new online system  Forward Publishing  together with Livingdocs and Netcetera the minds behind the new publishing solution.

Let's omit all the old technology,  was the decision of the publishing couple Friedrich the new owners of the Berliner Zeitung. The agile publishing solution at Neue Zürcher Zeitung convinced them after a worldwide scan of the technology options. This has been in use at Switzerland's oldest newspaper since 2017. Behind it are the start. up company Livingdocs and the software company Netcetera. With the lean technology components of  Forward Publishing  they implemented an initial package that inspires both editorial staff and readers because it runs intuitively and quickly.

It was fast,  explains Aljoscha Brell head of Berliner Newsroom GmbH.  Normally such conversion projects take one year to design and two years to implement. Thanks to the Swiss product developers and implementation partners we were able to launch the website a redesign and the entire production system in record time on 8 November and roll out the native apps around two weeks later.”

Forward Publishing  is a complete solution for media houses and publishers that can be installed and rolled out within a few weeks. Netcetera teamed up with CMS manufacturer Livingdocs in January after having developed various publishing products together for the NZZ media group and other large publishers. The  Forward Publishing  package is modular digital and supports the mobile. first approach.

The current layout now looks tidy .  the old page was static and unsorted in comparison. We can now highlight key topics and vary the design with elements. Everything is just much more coherent than before which was constantly taken into account during development,  explains Julia Grass Head of Social Media at Berliner Zeitung.  They really excelled our expectations,  praises Brell.  The main thing is that the team commits itself and can make quick decisions. Thanks to the Swiss who were responsible for the project we managed to achieve such good quality in such a short time .

From closed property funds to open digital assets .  Secure token offerings as alternative for private investors

Crypto Assets / Digital Assets can open up the world of real estate financing for private investors based on blockchain protocols. This enables attractive participation in real estate with secure token offerings.

If we value all global assets the total amounts to approximately USD 205 trillion of financial assets worldwide and approximately USD 127 trillion of non. financial assets such as real estate (World Council World Bank Coinbase 2019). Assuming a growth of 4. 5% total assets will increase to about USD 405 trillion by 2024 (Credit Suisse World Cup Report 2018). The share of so. called digital assets is still negligible today: USD 230 billion including Bitcoin as a payment token with a market value of approximately USD 85 billion (2020 Jan. coinbase). If we assume that only 1% of digital assets will be available in 2025 this will amount to 4.1 trillion USD – and of this a high proportion of real estate will certainly be available.

Tokenization the digitization of the transferability of property rights works especially well in real estate. Institutional investors high valuations and low liquidity have so far shaped projects in the real estate industry. Access for private investors is limited. The valuation up to pricing is very extensive and involves a lot of specific knowledge.

According to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) participation rights represent real values of the underlying investment objects. In addition to shares and bonds these can also be physical assets such as real estate. The Federal Supervisory Authority for Financial Markets (BAFIN) in Germany considers tokens as digital assets with included rights and obligations and their possible transferability.

The digitalization of global assets as an opportunity for private investors

In Germany the first securities prospectus for a secure token offering was approved in Europe at the beginning of 2019; the underlying instrument was originally a registered bond. Designed as an investment it would have been subject to the German Investment Act. However this alternative based on a block chain protocol as a secure token offering increased tradability and thus access for private investors.

This issuance by the Fundament Group from Berlin had a total volume of 250 million Euro Security Tokens with an underlying German real estate portfolio. The split in security tokens enabled the participation of a large number of investors. The issuance was structured as a token. based bond with an annually variable interest rate of between 4. 8%. Technically this was implemented based on the ERC. 20 Ethereum token with a runtime until 2033. Ethereum is a specific blockchain protocol that enables the issuance of tokens on standardized technical token protocols e.g. the ERC. 20.

In a persistently negative interest rate environment with attractive valuations especially the digitalization of real estate can offer private investors attractive opportunities. Through tokenization the decomposition into smallest parts private investors can also be enabled to participate and can be added under the aspect of portfolio diversification.

A decisive criterion for the sale is certainly the pricing. In the real estate sector this is dependent on many factors: Location local price level connection to infrastructure etc. Thus pricing is central and business. critical in real estate valuation as a prerequisite for the issue both with a classic bond and with security tokens. It is and remains a competitive advantage for the providers and a transparency factor for the investment decision – also seen within the framework of the legal requirements for investment transactions such as MIFID 2 in Germany and FIDLEG in Switzerland.

Blockchain technology as an opportunity for the liquidity of digital assets

In the meantime the structuring of such projects has also progressed a long way from a financial market regulatory perspective and has little in common with the Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) from the early days of the blockchain / crypto hype. This is a matter of tradable rights and the legislators in Germany and Switzerland are endeavoring to sharpen the legal framework further with regard to transferability tradability and insolvency law.

Analogous to the blockchain philosophy without intermediaries like banks a bond on differently structured real estate investments can be made directly accessible to private investors as an asset class. They are not investing in crypto currencies but in payment tokens that are not subject to high volatility

Ultimately the tradability and thus the liquidity of this asset class is also linked to the availability of a secondary market. No ask price without a bid price the liquidity of an investment ultimately always depends on the tradability of supply and demand. We are still in the early stages here but even in this market segment so. called crypto banks and other financial intermediaries are making efforts to act as a catalyst of supply and demand on established and new digital trading platforms. The democratization of an elite asset class which was previously largely reserved for institutional investors has begun. The possibilities of blockchain technology and innovative tools for asset pricing are the enablers especially with standardized token and blockchain protocols. So. called intelligent contracts (Smart Contracts) allow to trade the shares on a blockchain infrastructure automatically and to automate specific pricing. This can significantly reduce transaction costs another advantage for private investors.

Netcetera has extensive experience in digitization and tokenization the implementation of blockchain and distributed ledger (DLT) technologies and especially in digital pricing of local real estate objects. For over 20 years we have been implementing business. critical processes in software as individual solutions for our clients or as products. We have

provided support in the pricing of real estate and in real estate portfolio management within the scope of customer projects

. Our software components can be found in pricing tools of real estate consultants and in platforms for real estate trading. We are able to support the entire value chain of the conception tokenization technical implementation on blockchain protocols and pricing of the objects up to the digital distribution of the tokens.

Payment trend scouting .  Where does the journey in digital payment take us?

Presentation and workshop on  payspectives  at the ProfitCard

Where does the journey in digital payment take us? Where are we at present what trends can already be observed and what further developments are clearly emerging? And what influencing factors are important for a realistic assessment?

For the Swiss software company Netcetera the intensive study of such questions is of fundamental importance. After all it is about actively shaping the future of payment. Trend scouting is a proven method for a structured approach. Kurt Schmid Managing Director Digital Payment at Netcetera coined the term  payspectives  in connection with payment. He explained his findings at the ProfitCard conference in Berlin.

The starting point are the trends which can already be clearly identified. For example contactless payments with cards are very advanced despite initial strong criticism of security and data protection in many media. Equally impressive are the successes of mobile payments .  especially in connection with wallets like Apple Pay. The use of biometrics for authentication and the opening of bank interfaces through PSD2 also play an important role. In addition there are other trends such as the strong growth in online payment merchant apps with integrated payment and finally continuous improvements in user. friendliness for all electronic payment methods.

There are also ideas that have not yet achieved a breakthrough. Examples include the topics  Blockchain for standard payments   payment with wearables   payment in the Internet of Things (IoT)  or  cashless supermarkets  such as Amazon Go.

In order to delve into all these topics Netcetera also organized a workshop at ProfitCard. The idea was to summarize the trends in clusters to give the discussions a meaningful structure. The cluster titles: card related (e.g. European scheme 3DS 2.x) KYC related (e.g. eIDAS FIDO) technology related (e.g. tokenization delegated authentication Blockchain) UX & functional (e.g. in. app payment pay by face) ecosystem related (e.g. bank as platform provider GAFAs as partners) account related (e.g. instant payments). Kurt Schmid:  With this we have hit the nerve of the participants. They all worked intensively with great interest and commitment.

Entering the market as pioneers we are now one of the most experienced and comprehensive mobile developers.

As pioneers we entered the mobile development market in 2008 with the very first Swiss app Wemlin for the first iPhone. Wemlin was ready for smart watches in time for the launch of the Apple Watch. Today with several hundred apps deployed in the app stores we are one of the largest and most important players in the market.

Our software fits all end. products. Usually an app has to be developed for different platforms (iOS Android etc.). Besides an app consists not only of the app itself but needs a technical „contact“: the server. In many projects this even is the main part of the development. This means that various technologies are used for one product and the selection of the used technologies is a deciding factor for the success of an app.

With us you benefit from a 360 degree skill set for the world of mobile development – from finding ideas to strategy visual design and development down to the depths of the backend. As full stack supplier we master all required technologies. Our various apps for all industries show that we understand business processes and know how to reproduce them in the mobile world.

ToPay eCom Token Connector .  Contactless mobile payment supporting biometrics

Increase eCommerce conversion and security for card. based transactions with scheme tokenization

Network tokenization through the schemes connects merchants with issuing banks. This results in various advantages compared to PSP proprietary tokens.

Scheme tokens are processed with EMV transaction cryptograms which increases the security of payment transactions to a level similar to the security of a card. present transaction. In addition this increases approval rates based on risk decisions.

the use of scheme tokens results in better risk scores at issuers
