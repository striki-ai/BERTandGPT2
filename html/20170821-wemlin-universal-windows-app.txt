The public transport app is now a Universal Windows app
 Wemlin for Windows is no longer a pure smartphone app. We have further developed the popular app for public transport into a Universal Windows app and brought it to the latest state of technology. It now runs on all devices with Windows 10. The data is obtained from the new "Open Data Platform Ã–V Schweiz". The great advantage for the users: they can check the departure times of train, tram, bus and ship of all the public transport companies in Switzerland even faster. 
With the passenger information app Wemlin, the travelers know the departures in their vicinity at any time, whether with iOS, Android or Windows Phone. We now have developed Wemlin for the Windows 10 platform. In the start menu view the next departures of the user’s personal favorite stations are displayed. If you want to use other Wemlin features, you can open the app by clicking on the desktop tile.
A further advantage is the connection to the new
of the Federal Office of Transport. The platform provides all timetable data, as well as the current and the expected traffic situation of public transport in real time. Wemlin for Windows now shows the departure times of all Swiss public transport companies – anytime and anywhere. Friedemann Bürgel, member of the managing board of opendata.ch, says: "We are very pleased that this popular and widely-used app can now use the new platform. Open data is increasingly becoming an infrastructure that benefits the general public.”
The existing Windows Smartphone app is replaced by the Universal Windows app. The new app can be downloaded
for free. Wemlin for Android and iOS remain and can be used for the Zürich transport network, Liechtenstein Mobil and the transport networks Ostwind, Nordwestschweiz and Frimobil.
With Wemlin, the travelers know the departures in their vicinity at any time.
