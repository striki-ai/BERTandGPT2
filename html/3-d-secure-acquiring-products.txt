 The 3-D Secure Aquiring Products from Netcetera ensure the smooth and reliable processing of payments when consumers shop over the internet. The 3DS Server, 3DS SDK and 3DS MPI come with contemporary web services for the verification and authentication of the cardholder. 
As an integral part of the online shopping process, the Netcetera 3-D Secure Acquiring Products authenticate and verify the cardholder against Visa Secure (Verified by Visa), Mastercard® Identity Check™ (SecureCode™), American Express Safekey®, Diners Club ProtectBuy®, JCB J/Secure™, Mir Accept and UnionPay UPOP. Merchants enabling 3-D Secure transactions benefit from a liability shift to the card issuer and thereby reduce their risk for non-authenticated transactions and associated refunds and lost revenue.
Netcetera offers 3-D Secure Acquiring Products for 3DS 1.0 and 2.0: The homemade 3DS Server and 3DS SDK products for 3DS 2.0 complement the Merchant Plug-In (MPI), a proven product that is highly valued by customers all over the world for its smooth integration. The products are based on latest technologies and have a contemporary architecture, which can be flexibly developed further to support future requirements. A comprehensive dashboard as well as log data and statistics are available for monitoring, fulfilling the requirements of the card schemes.
Netcetera's 3DS MPI, 3DS Server and 3DS SDK can be licensed and operated on site on the infrastructure of the merchants. Alternatively, the product architecture allows a central operation for several merchants run by a payment service provider (PSP) or by an acquirer or a bank.
