 We are one of the first payment service providers to successfully execute 3-D Secure 2.0 transactions in Switzerland together with Datatrans AG, CornÃ¨rcard and Sweepay AG. This makes us one of the first providers worldwide to successfully implement this new security standard with credit, prepaid and debit cards in online trading.

can also execute PSD2 and EMV 3DS (3-D Secure 2.0) compliant payments with
Cardholders benefit from risk-based authentication, additional security and ease of use when making mobile payments with credit, prepaid and debit cards. The first real 3-D Secure 2.0 transactions were processed via
AG's online shop. These are based on 3-D Secure 2.0 certified products developed by Netcetera and implemented by Datatrans.
Peter Frick, Managing Director Payment Security at Netcetera, says: "Our software enables these successful transactions. The increasing demand in the DACH region shows that the market has been waiting for this solution. 3-D Secure 2.0 is a milestone for digital payment and now a reality in Switzerland thanks to this implementation".
"We are proud to be among the first payment service providers in the world to be certified by Visa, Mastercard and American Express 3-D Secure 2.0 and to have completed successful transactions. With the new solution, consumers and e-commerce merchants will benefit from a smooth checkout, improved conversion rates and maximum security," says Oliver Heister, CTO of Datatrans AG.
