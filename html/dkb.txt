Activate credit cards in app and release payments easily, quickly and securely
For DKB we have modernized the 3-D Secure process and implemented the payment approval via biometrics. We integrated the 3DS functions of the DKB Card-Secure App, such as the registration and payment authorization for card payments, into their bank app. This eliminates the necessity to send an identity code by post to activate a card for payments. The implemented security procedure complies with the PSD2 regulations.
