Netcetera 3DS Server and Netcetera 3DS SDK got UnionPay certification
Major improvement for e-commerce payments worldwide
 UnionPay, one of the worldâ€™s largest bankcard schemes, certified the Netcetera 3DS Server and SDK for UnionPay card transactions. The Swiss software company and expert for digital payment solutions, Netcetera, is market leader for 3-D Secure and recently opened an office in Singapore to bring their scheme-certified payment products to the APAC region. The UnionPay certification will substantially improve user experience for e-commerce, promoting secure and frictionless consumer authentication for online transactions with all UnionPay cards worldwide. 
In 2019, e-commerce accounted for 14% of all retail sales worldwide. Almost 2 billion people purchased their goods and services online, with Asia-Pacific still leading the global e-commerce growth. Cardholders’ demand for a better payment experience and improved security drives the market forward, and in the current extraordinary times, providing secure and user-friendly digital payment solutions is becoming even more important.
Driving security and convenience of online payments, Netcetera has successfully completed the testing and certification with UnionPay for their Netcetera 3DS Server and 3DS SDK products. UnionPay has enabled card acceptance in 178 countries and regions with issuance in 61 countries and regions. According to the Nilsen Report (Issue 1154) issued in May, 2019, UnionPay is the world’s largest bankcard scheme in terms of transaction volume, holding a market share of about 44.13%.
Peter Frick, Managing Director Secure Digital Payments at Netcetera, says: “We are very proud to be able to offer EMV 3DS, PCI and scheme-certified products. The certification with UnionPay is a huge opportunity for merchants and e-commerce worldwide.” Customers of the Netcetera 3DS Server SaaS and 3DS SDK can get a waiver for certification with UnionPay. The 3DS Server ensures the smooth and reliable processing of card payments from online shops. Payment Service Providers and Acquirers can easily integrate with the Netcetera 3DS Server to ensure that their online shops support strong authentication according to card networks’ and governments' regulations, offer a seamless cardholder experience and generate a larger number of transactions.
