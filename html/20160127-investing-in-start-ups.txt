We are investing in start-ups from Switzerland and the Balkan region
 We are looking for promising start-ups from Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia and create a position to steer these investments. 
The plan is to make up to five investments in 2016 and to invest with a similar pace over the next few years. Start-ups can expect to receive not only financial support, but also other resources such as expertise and market access that a company like Netcetera can offer.
Founded as a start-up 20 years ago, Netcetera has gained experiences with start-up investments over the years. It has made successful investments in Swiss start-ups in the past, in companies like D1 Solutions and Braingroup. Now the software company is looking for promising start-ups in the regions where it is doing business and has created a position to steer and manage the investment endeavors.
Andrej Vckovski, CEO of Netcetera, commented: „We see a lot of potential in the market and are ready to invest and expand our reach. Switzerland is our home and we already know the region of Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia well, as we have invested here in the past. The proof is our important location in Macedonia with 130 employees. We firmly believe that the talent in the region is exceptional and we want to support promising start-ups.”
In order to properly manage its investment efforts, Netcetera teamed up with Darko Butina, as Chief Investment Officer. Butina brings extensive start-up, managerial and investment related experiences from leading various companies, among others also leading Mimovrste (Slovenia’s largest web shop) to successful exit. He also founded two start-ups (“Povej! svoje mnenje” and “SASH reporting”) and is an active investor in Slovenia (one of the founding investors in Silicon Gardens Fund), Serbia (Power Media Group – Tracara.com and Savrsena.com) and also in Switzerland.
“I am excited to lead Netcetera’s investment efforts and look forward to supporting great start-ups from Switzerland, the Balkan region and beyond. As investor we offer not only financial means and investment knowledge, but also significant entrepreneurial and management expertise.” says Darko Butina. Netcetera plans to invest in start-ups that are active in the industries it operates in, such as fintech, connected health, transit tech, digital enterprise, web apps and software for media and entertainment and law enforcement.
