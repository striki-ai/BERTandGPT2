Netcetera wins Award from Swiss Railway for outstanding IT Performance
Recognition of many Years of Cooperation on highly complex Projects
 At Swiss Railway (SBB) Suppliersâ€™ Day on 7 September 2011, Swiss IT service provider Netcetera was awarded for its outstanding performance in informatics. Decisive factors for the reward were price, service and adherence to delivery dates. 
For the second time, Swiss Railway (SBB) invited its key partners and suppliers to Bern for the SBB Suppliers’ Day event on 7 September 2011. For SBB the occasion provides an opportunity to strengthen the bonds with its partners and to update them about SBB's goals and priorities in purchasing and supply chain. Outstanding supplier performance is honored by the presentation of awards in the Fleet, Technology, Construction, Service and Informatics categories. Netcetera received the award for informatics. Honorably mentioned were its abilities on finding solutions rather than scapegoats and its maximum flexibility to handle time-critical situations.
The cooperation between Netcetera and SBB began in 2002 with Pathfinder, a web-based railway coordination system. Pathfinder gives European railway companies a central web platform for managing international trains. The next milestone in the relationship was the development and project management of the NeTS train schedule planning software, which has been used since 2008 to generate SBB’s train schedules. In June 2011 SBB and Netcetera forged a strategic partnership for the development of business-critical software.
«We are highly honored to be distinguished by SBB as the best informatics supplier», comments Andrej Vckovski, CEO of the Netcetera Group. «The award and the partnership are the reward for our philosophy of always cooperating very closely and goal-oriented with our customers and utilizing their specialist knowledge in the software development process. This ensured that our employees were able to come up with the best possible solutions to the extremely complex tasks for Pathfinder and NeTS.»
