Devices, possibilities and new business models
 Does AR/MR create value for marketing? Our AR expert Reto Grob and Reto Senn from bitforge provided the participants of the SOMEXcircle in December 2018 with an overview of devices and possibilities. The experts showed how AR can be used today and the high potential of the technology. In the practical part, participants learned how they can develop 3D models and their own solutions.
