 Conversational Interfaces 
Digital revolution in everyday working life
AR and CI Workshop in Liechtenstein
 What is still in its infancy today is already revolutionizing the working world of tomorrow: At a workshop of the Digital Liechtenstein initiative, we demonstrated how augmented reality and conversational interfaces are pushing into the business world. 
Pokemon Go, an Augmented Reality-based smartphone game launched in the summer of 2016, thrilled the crowds. Players all over the world were drawn outdoors to hunt monsters with their smartphone camera. The possibility of merging the real and virtual worlds holds enormous potential not only for game developers - the technology is already pushing into the everyday lives of many people. Today, hardly any car is built without a head-up display that shows the most important driving data directly in the driver's field of vision. We are convinced that the technology will also shape many people's everyday working lives in the near future. At a workshop held in the context of the
initiative Digital Liechtenstein
at the Technopark in Vaduz, our experts demonstrated how virtual reality headsets like the HoloLens can already be used to make the maintenance of railway cars more efficient, how complex industrial machines can be projected into training rooms as virtual 3D models for training purposes, or how doctors can be supported in the preparation of difficult operations. Through the various examples, the approximately 70 workshop participants gained an exciting insight into the many possible applications of the new technology and were able to convince themselves of its practical suitability during the break with one of the HoloLenses on their heads.
New interface, new possibilities
Whether Siri, Alexa or Google Home, companies have been experimenting with artificial intelligence and the new man-machine interface Conversational Interfaces for several years. In the second part of the workshop, our experts showed what it means when machines learn to communicate directly with customers without a screen. With voice-controlled artificial intelligence, for example, shop visits can be carried out entirely online, timetable queries and ticket purchases can be made or automatic logs of consultations can be generated, which not only save an immense amount of time, but also help to ensure quality.
Whether Augmented Reality or Conversational Interfaces: The workshop impressively illustrated to the participants which new possibilities technological progress generates and provided inspiration to think about new business possibilities for one’s own company.
