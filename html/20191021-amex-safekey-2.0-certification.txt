First in Europe with Amex Safekey 2.0 certification
The Netcetera 3DS ACS is ready as one of only three worldwide
 We are happy to announce that we have successfully completed the testing and certification with Amex for the Netcetera 3DS ACS. In addition to being the very first ACS with the Letter of Approval from Mastercard, our product is currently also the first in Europe and only the third worldwide with Safekey 2.0 certification. With certifications for the latest standards by Amex, Visa and Mastercard, our ACS is now ready for the major card schemes. 
Future customers of the Netcetera 3DS ACS will not need to do any certification to process Mastercard, Visa and Amex transactions according to 2.0 standards. Issuers and banks can easily integrate with the Netcetera 3DS ACS to support strong authentication according regulation, offer a seamless cardholder experience and generate a larger number of successful transactions.
