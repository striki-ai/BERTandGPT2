Netcetera 3DS Server certified for Discover ProtectBuyÂ®
One of the first vendors with certified 3DS SDK product
 We are very happy to announce that our Netcetera 3DS Server and Netcetera 3DS SDK are certified for the Discoverâ€™s ProtectBuyÂ® program. We are able to support merchants with strong authentication and verification of Diners Club cardholders at a very early stage. 
The 3DS SDK from Netcetera ensures the smooth and reliable processing of card payments from a native merchant app and the 3DS Server from a web shop. Merchants can easily integrate these products to ensure that their app or web shop supports strong authentication and generates a larger number of transactions.
