Once upon a time: entering digits manually
The PostFinance app by Netcetera with touch ID and QR code
 The PostFinance app was the first Swiss app with a payment feature. It won silver and bronze for Innovation and Online-Marketing at the Best of Swiss Web award. 
One of the most popular e-banking apps, the
developed by Netcetera, is even more user friendly now. Thanks to the touch ID function, the iOS app users can access their finances simply by putting their finger on the iPhone – easy, secure and where ever they are. Mobile money transfer has also been simplified: individuals can easily transfer money among themselves by creating and scanning QR codes. The QR codes contain the IBAN number and make entering the 21 digits manually superfluous.
