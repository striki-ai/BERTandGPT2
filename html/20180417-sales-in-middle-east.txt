We are reinforcing our team Middle East
New Director of Sales and Business Development in Dubai
 Ramy Fouda has been appointed as Director of Sales and Business Development for our office in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. He has more than 20 years of experience in the IT sector, and his focus will be on expanding Netceteraâ€™s business and market share in the Middle East region and other non-European territories. 
“Netcetera is committed to growing its business beyond the European continent and exploring business opportunities via our office in Dubai. We aim to take our software and ideas beyond borders, accelerating our expansion through a partner-led strategy, and are building on the back of several successful projects, in the financial and healthcare sectors of the UAE market. We are confident that Ramy’s proven track record in his previous roles will help us to provide new, high-quality solutions that meet market trends – also thanks to strategic alliances and collaboration with partners” said Kiril Milev, Managing Director of Netcetera Middle East.
Before joining us, Ramy worked at several technology companies and banking solution providers, building dynamic and successful teams and growing the business in each organization.
“The rapid changes and risks in today’s market force IT providers to be more agile and to introduce new technology to help their end customers to cope with challenges,” said Ramy. “Netcetera is a focused, high-quality technology provider mainly in Europe with a lot of potential to grow in other parts of the world. I am looking forward to working together with the teams across Europe to achieve this goal”.
