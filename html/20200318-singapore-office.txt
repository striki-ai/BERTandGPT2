Netcetera takes another step towards global expansion with office in Singapore
 "Expanding our Horizon" - under this motto Netcetera expands to Singapore in 2020. The Swiss software company and expert for digital payment solutions implements its global growth strategy with concrete measures and opened an office in Singapore in March. In addition to the office in Dubai, they want to advance further East with their highly secure and scheme-certified payment products. 
In March 2020, Netcetera opened its fifteenth location with an office in Singapore. Singapore is considered the financial capital and fintech hub of the region and is another step towards the East for Netcetera. "With Singapore we are setting the next milestone in our going global strategy" says Dr. Andrej Vckovski, CEO of the Netcetera Group. He is aware that competition in the APAC region is fierce, "but as the market leader in 3DS in the DACH region and with the excellent payment products already well established in Europe, we are a competitive player for the Asian market. The current situation demands even more stable, secure and mobile payment options for e-commerce worldwide." Netcetera offers excellent digital solutions for secure payment, mobile banking, mobile contactless payment, digital wallet and 3-D Secure Services for secure online transactions, to name just a few examples of their service portfolio.
Closer to customers with an experienced managing director
Until now, Netcetera supported its Asian clients from Europe and Middle East. With the step into the Far East, Netcetera is now closer to them and thus improves the cooperation. This enables Netcetera to better respond to their customers’ needs and to find optimal solutions for their business. In addition, the new location also contributes to the early detection of regional market trends and a better understanding of the market as well as the ability to help shape it.
Kiril Milev, Netcetera employee for many years and most recently Managing Director Middle East, will become Managing Director in Singapore. His ongoing work at Netcetera provides him with business and technological knowledge as well as a lot of experience in the near-shore context. In his role as Managing Director, Kiril Milev is responsible for business development and customer relations. "We see great opportunities to establish ourselves on the Asian market", says Kiril Milev. "Our specialists’ know how to meet the requirements of the financial technology industry with their in-depth expertise and our qualitative range of products and services".
