Experience digitalization live in the Innovation Hub for the Digital Enterprise
 At CeBIT on 14 - 18 March, we are taking you on a digital journey into the mountains â€“ from a pre-ordered and pre-paid coffee first thing in the morning to mobile train tickets and ski passes, all the way up to the ski slopes.
