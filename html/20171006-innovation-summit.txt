Presentation and article by our digital payment expert
At the end of September 2017, our Innovation Summit on trend-setting payment solutions took place in Munich for already the 12th time. Topics such as digitalisation of payment transactions, mobile payments, regulatory guidelines, new players in the market and the positioning of various platforms were discussed. Our Managing Director Digital Payments, Kurt Schmid, explained what our digital wallet does for banks and credit card issuers for payment with a smartphone at the point-of-sale and on the Internet. Practically at the same time, an interview with Kurt Schmid on this topic was published in the magazine "Schweizer Bank".
