MORE ABOUT OUR INDUSTRIES AND TOPICS
We are the specialist for software products and custom solutions - from strategy to operations.
 Member of the Board of Directors
Our employees enjoy the fact that they can count on every member of our community. We are proud of our many loyal employees.
As a leading Swiss software company, we support our customers worldwide with trend-setting products and custom software.
Entering the market as pioneers, we are now one of the most experienced and comprehensive mobile developers.
As pioneers we entered the mobile development market in 2008 with the very first Swiss app Wemlin for the first iPhone. Wemlin was ready for smart watches in time for the launch of the Apple Watch. Today, with several hundred apps deployed in the app stores, we are one of the largest and most important players in the market.
Our software fits all end-products. Usually, an app has to be developed for different platforms (iOS, Android etc.). Besides, an app consists not only of the app itself, but needs a technical „contact“: the server. In many projects, this even is the main part of the development. This means that various technologies are used for one product and the selection of the used technologies is a deciding factor for the success of an app.
With us you benefit from a 360 degree skill set for the world of mobile development – from finding ideas to strategy, visual design and development, down to the depths of the backend. As full stack supplier, we master all required technologies. Our various apps for all industries show that we understand business processes and know how to reproduce them in the mobile world. In the area mobile banking, we are the largest supplier in Switzerland: almost all cantonal banks and other banks such as PostFinance and Migros Bank count on our comprehensive services.
