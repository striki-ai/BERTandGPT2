3-D Secure solution with Credorax
Leveraging Artificial Intelligence
 Credorax, the NextGen merchant acquiring bank, has implemented our EMV 3DS certified acquiring products into its payment processing gateway. They added an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based optimization engine that analyses each transaction in real-time for the best business results. This early-market offering will assist merchants with their compliance requirements to card schemes and European regulations in the most seamless way possible, ensuring high acceptance rates. 
developed their latest solution “Smart 3D Secure” in partnership with us: it is built on top of our 3-D Secure acquiring products (MPI, 3DS Server and 3DS SDK), which are EMVCo certified and compliant with major EMV 3-D Secure scheme programs. With this solution, Netcetera and Credorax help merchants improve conversions, optimise their checkout process, reduce fraud, and stay protected from fraudulent chargeback liability.
The transition to the new 3-D Secure 2.0 protocol is going into effect this year. Our EMV certified 3DS acquiring products comply with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) requirements for strong user authentication. As a result, the “Smart 3D Secure” is also PSD2 compliant. Cerdorax’s “3D Secure Adviser” is an AI-based flexible decision layer that analyses each transaction in real time and decides on the best 3-D Secure routing, including risk assessment and exemption management.
“New mandated processing requirements can be seen as a burden, but they can also drive innovation. In this instance, it inspired us to develop a solution for optimized usage of 3-D Secure, facilitating frictionless customer authentication and smooth customer experiences,” said Moshe Selfin, Chief Operations Officer and Chief Technology Officer at Credorax. “We are excited to partner with Netcetera to launch this NextGen solution, which offers our merchants the added advantage of compliancy to the Strong Customer Authentication requirements in the upcoming Payment Services Directive 2.”
“We are excited to build on our strong relationship with Credorax, a company that understands the evolutionary loops in tech and regulation and can react quickly to best serve their customers,” said Andrej Vckovski, CEO of Netcetera. “We are proud to provide certified EMV 3-D Secure products on which Credorax has built their solution.”
