Netcetera develops Knowledge Engine for Health
Swiss Expertise supports Abu Dhabi Health Authority
The Swiss IT service provider Netcetera and its branch office in the United Arab Emirates have developed the Knowledge Engine for Health (KEH) for the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi (HAAD). This solution allows the general health of the population and the overall performance of the healthcare system to be monitored, regulated and improved. As a specialist in cross-platform software development with many years of experience in Swiss electronic healthcare projects, Netcetera utilised a data model to develop the business intelligence solution, which converts electronic claims submitted to health insurance companies by service providers into an analytical database that can be used for general strategic purposes.
The Knowledge Engine for Health enables the
to ensure the quality of medical care in the emirate. The mature, high-performance business intelligence solution captures electronic data routinely exchanged between healthcare providers and health insurance companies. The extensive, anonymised data elements on the forms are mapped into a multi-dimensional data cube. This allows the data to be analysed according to diverse needs. In the meantime, Netcetera has also deployed KEH at the National Health Insurance Company Daman in Abu Dhabi.
“Netcetera’s agile deployment of deep expertise has been critical in delivering this demanding solution during a period of rapid health system reform,” said Dr. Philipp Vetter, Director of Strategy at the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi. “The design and high quality of the software is such that we now license KEH to payers and providers under an open source agreement, which is proving to be of significant value for our stakeholders. We value Netcetera’s willingness to partner with us and challenge us, while adapting very flexibly to our specific needs and reliably delivering solutions that do not compromise on quality.”
“Our technology expertise and our many years of experience with the Swiss healthcare system were very helpful in the development process. We were able to incorporate this knowledge – the latest technologies and trends – into this project, in particular in the business intelligence environment, and adapt it to the needs of the healthcare system of Abu Dhabi,” commented Jacqueline Duvoisin, Managing Director, Netcetera Middle East.
