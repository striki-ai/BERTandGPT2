First Swiss Railway Timetable with Netcetera Software
Successful Planning - First Endurance Test passed
Since 13 December 2009, the Swiss Railway is running according to schedule 2010. The timetable was planned with software by Netcetera. With it,
plans all journeys of freight and passenger trains. The internationally awarded Swiss software passed the first endurance test well on the day of the timetable change: A derailment at Zürich's main station necessitated the re-scheduling of more than 1,000 trains. The exemplary and close cooperation between customer and the project partners Netcetera, Ergon and NOSE was essential for the successful start of the new planning software.
