MORE ABOUT OUR INDUSTRIES AND TOPICS
We are the specialist for software products and custom solutions - from strategy to operations.
 Member of the Board of Directors
Our employees enjoy the fact that they can count on every member of our community. We are proud of our many loyal employees.
As a leading Swiss software company, we support our customers worldwide with trend-setting products and custom software.
 With Cultura, we commit to culture, education, recreation and society. We support cultural events. But we also welcome valuable projects in other areas, such as environmental protection, sports of all kinds, social projects, education and much more. If you have a brilliant idea for an event or an activity, contact us to inquire about support. 
How can I receive support for my project?
Please send us a brief description of your project via e-mail, including the budget. Please comply with the formal requirements indicated below.
We process the applications we receive on a continuous basis. The review takes some time, therefore we urge you to apply at least three months before the implementation of the project.
Acceptance or rejection of projects is usually communicated within four weeks after we receive the application. Netcetera Cultura makes the financial resources available within six weeks after acceptance of a project. The Cultura commission does not render an account of its decisions.
What is the level of potential support provided by Netcetera Cultura?
Grant amounts are usually between CHF 500 and CHF 3,000. As long as Netcetera can provide meaningful support for a project, non-monetary contributions will also be granted. Netcetera Cultura does not require exclusivity in the project sponsorship and will also support projects that already have sponsors. However, we would like for our support to provide a significant contribution to the success of the project.
You commit to the following if you accept the support:
confirm receipt of the support contribution.
implement the project according to the schedule or inform Netcetera Cultura about any changes.
prepare a financial statement after implementing the project and send it to Netcetera Cultura.
create project documentation and provide it to Netcetera Cultura.
if possible, refer to the Netcetera Cultura support in a suitable manner, and submit the plans for this to Netcetera Cultura for approval before publication.
allow Netcetera (and its group companies) to publish information about the support in any media at any time.
Formal requirements for your application:
Please note that we cannot process incomplete applications
Application must be in English (preferred) or in German / Macedonian
