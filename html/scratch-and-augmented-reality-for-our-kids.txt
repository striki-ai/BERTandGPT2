Scratch and Augmented Reality for Kids
 Also this year we participated in the national "Kidsday" which takes place once a year in Switzerland. On this day, children can visit their parents at work to get an insight into their jobs. 
We offered a full-day program, which two of our own apprentices organize every year. In total 16 boys and girls aged 11-14 years took part. In the morning the kids made their first steps in IT with using a programming software. "Scratch" is a simple visual programming language especially designed for kids and teenagers. During the day, they also had the opportunity to learn more about
(AR), one of our morst important innovation topic. The kids were keen on trying on the AR lenses and took a look on different AR projects. After a joint meal in one our our lunch restaurants, the kids got a tour trough our offices and then finished their first scratch projects.
