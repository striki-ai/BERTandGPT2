Criticism of capitalist art in Â«Motel BurnoutÂ»
Netcetera Cultura made a financial contribution to the «Motel Burnout» art exhibition, which took place from 6 to 20 September 2014 in the Bärengasse Museum in Zurich. The artists exhibited works on the theme of the financial sector serving as a kind of microcosm of excessive capitalism and as a prime example of the overall social change.
