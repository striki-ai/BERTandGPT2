Protection against credit card abuse during online payments
', " The global Â«3-D SecureÂ» standard enhances security for online credit card payments. In its data centers, Netcetera operates a multi-client capable 3-D Secure service. You as card issuers and banks benefit from Netcetera's longstanding 3-D Secure experience and its homemade technology, flexibly configurable to your needs.", '
The security and customer experience challenge
Consumers increasingly shop online, anytime, anywhere and from any device. Still, the shopping habits and needs of consumers differ depending on generation, individual background and digital affinity. At the same time, with the ongoing expansion of e-commerce, fraud with credit and debit cards is steadily on the rise. In addition to actual card theft, card details are being stolen and abused with electronic methods.
Against this background, you as the card issuer or bank are challenged to expand your security precautions to reduce the cases of fraud – while meeting the evolving expectations from your cardholders towards their means of payment, and while complying with a growing number of complex regulatory requirements.
3-D Secure service designed to meet your cardholders' expectations
The globally adopted 3-D Secure (3DS) standard increases security for online credit card transactions. 3-D Secure is commonly known under the web-shop quality labels «Verified by Visa», «Mastercard® Identity Check™ (SecureCode™)», «American Express SafeKey®», «Diners Club ProtectBuy®» or «JCB J/Secure™».
Built on 15 years' experience, Netcetera operates a comprehensive and flexible set of 3-D Secure services in order to best support card issuers' and banks' needs and requirements in a fast changing market.
State-of-the-art Access Control Server (ACS) supporting 3DS 1.0 and 2.0 protocol
Authentication methods that allow a positive payment experience for any consumer: \t
Out-of-band (OOB): Cardholder confirms the transaction with a single click in a mobile app
One-time passcode (OTP): Linked to the transaction data, delivered via text message, email or e-banking
Risk-based authentication (RBA): Integrate transaction scoring to prevent unnecessary cardholder interaction
Online registration portal for card enrollment and card management by the cardholder
Standardized web services for straightforward integration with the issuer portal, backend-provisioning of cards, life cycle management
Modern and user-friendly administration portal for back-office and call-center support, API for flexible integration
Comprehensive reporting engine based on Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
Benefits for card issuers and banks
Your flexibility and efficiency is our goal
The Netcetera 3-D Secure Issuer Service is designed to support nearly any use case, and enables a fast onboarding and a wide adoption by cardholders. In addition to the high configurability of the service, short development cycles and a dedicated delivery team facilitate your 3DS solution.
We take care of new regulations, industry standards and complexity
