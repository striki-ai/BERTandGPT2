Designing a better city with IoT
Senior Software Engineer Daniel Eichhornâ€™s presentation at HSG
 How can we help to solve environmental problems like air pollution, occasional flooding or excessive noise with a solution based on an IoT platform? Daniel Eichhorn spoke about SkopjePulse, a website that is based on our own IoT platform at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) to students of Economy. 
Everybody is talking about Internet of Things (IoT), but we wanted to actually do something. We developed
, an open IoT platform using TheThingsNetwork infrastructure to collect valuable data about air pollution, noise, temperature and humidity in the city of Skopje, Macedonia. Daniel explained at his guest lecture at HSG the basic components of IoT and also showed the challenges for doing IoT.
