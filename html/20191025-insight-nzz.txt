Insights into jointly mastered digital challenges
 At our Insight event in October, the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung gave participants an insight into its newsroom, the creation of the newspaper and their transformation into a digital and mobile first product. With this event, we offer invited guests from the top management of leading Swiss companies a platform for the exchange of information and ideas. 
With the Insight dialogue platform, we connect representatives from various industries for an insight into other companies and industries. The event on 21 October 2019 at
in Zurich offered an exciting exchange on the topic: How can companies work together with their partners to drive innovation forward? Netcetera and its partners accompanied the NZZ, Switzerland's oldest newspaper still published today, on its way to a successful digital organization. In the exciting discussion with experts from Netcetera and Andreas Bossecker, CTIO at NZZ, the participants learned how change management is best set up for such a multi-year mammoth task.
During the following guided tour through the newsroom, the participants were given an insight into the creation of the print and online daily newspaper. The NZZ also opened the venerable board meeting room, where the daily editorial meetings take place, to the participants of the Insight event.
