On 1 January 2016 we opened our branch office in Munich and continue to drive our growth strategy in the European market.

o strengthen its commitment to safe and convenient payment solutions, and to further expand its product business in Europe, Netcetera opened an office location in Munich on 1 January 2016. In doing so, the company ensures proximity to its growing number of customers.
