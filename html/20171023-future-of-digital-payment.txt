Conversational Interfaces and Augmented Reality
 Our experts Thomas Fromherz and Hugo Schotman show what the future of digital payment looks like in the following video (in German). 
After a brief introduction into the history of paying, Thomas Fromherz demonstrates a voice-controlled payment with an app. The process is similar to a website. Instead of tapping and clicking the commands, you simply say them out loud into your smartphone. Hugo Schotman then shows a few possibilities with the Hololens, e.g. how public transport tickets can be easily and quickly checked.
