VisecaOne credit card app turns one year old
500,000 registered users and two awards
 Just in time for its first anniversary, the 500,000 registered users of the VisecaOne app from the Aduno Group have made it the most widely used credit card app in Switzerland. The app, which was developed by us and Nothing Interactive, simplifies the digital lives of users. The jury of the Best of Swiss App Awards also honored VisecaOne in November 2016 with two awards. The app won the highest award among all financial apps submitted. 
, 500,000 users have already registered for it. We have developed additional new features for the third release in December 2016, making the digital lives of users even easier. The app also impressed the jury for the
, and was the only financial app to win a silver award in the “Functionality” category and a bronze award in the “Business” category. The jury's verdict: “VisecaOne allows credit card relations to be managed on a mobile basis and allows transactions to be confirmed with the app instead of with a password. The app features very good usability, a clean layout, and visibility of only relevant information. If you have a Viseca credit card, you cannot do without this app.”
Users also confirm its high market relevance: Since its launch, VisecaOne has been ranked number 1 in the “Free finance” category in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for 46 of 52 weeks. The rankings are based on the download figures, which illustrate the popularity of an app.
With the free VisecaOne digital service, users have 24/7 access to all important information pertaining to their card. They can view card details such as insurance services, manage their personal settings, or keep track of ongoing expenses in real time. In addition, online payments that require the 3-D Secure Standard can be easily managed and confirmed via the app or SMS code.
We implemented additional features for the third release of the app at the beginning of December 2016, e.g. for the Apple watch app. With intuitive animation, the user can see the total expenditures for the credit card and the credit still available directly on their watch. Payment and login requests can also be confirmed quickly and securely directly in the push notification message on the watch or on the lock screen of the mobile device.
issues the credit cards and prepaid cards for the Raiffeisen Gruppe, all cantonal banks, the Migros Bank, Bank Coop, regional banks and private and commercial banks.
With the VisecaOne app for Apple Watch, you have all the important information about your cards at your fingertips â€“ a simple, intuitive overview of your spending per card, plus quick, secure confirmation of the two-factor authentication requests via push notification and transaction notifications in real time.
All the important information relating to your card is available at a glance
Confirmation requests provide an additional level of security (second factor) for all actions outside the app.
