Netcetera 3DS Server approved by EMVCo as first 3-D Secure 2.0 product in Europe
Easier and faster secure online payments
', " The Swiss payment expert Netcetera, market leader in 3-D Secure, has received the EMVCo Letter of Approval for its 3-D Secure Server. Acquirers and merchants can now use Netcetera's product to enroll in the 3DS 2.0 platforms of all credit card schemes.", '
Merchants and acquirers face the challenge of constantly expanding their security measures to reduce fraud during online shopping. At the same time, the expectations of their cardholders regarding the user-friendliness of payment methods and the complexity of regulatory requirements are increasing. The new 3-D Secure specification 3DS 2.0, also called EMV® 3DS, addresses these challenges. Cardholders do not need to remember passwords anymore and can confirm payments smoothly from a mobile app – be it when shopping from a web shop or an app.
EMVCo, as the payment industry’s technical body aiming at facilitating worldwide interoperability and acceptance of secure payment transactions, approves products that meet all regulatory requirements for 3DS 2.0. After a product is approved, a merchant or acquirer can start negotiations and integration with the credit card schemes’ 3DS platforms.
We are proud that the 3DS Server product from Netcetera is among the three first EMVCo approved 3DS 2.0 products worldwide and the first in the Europe. It passed all functional tests and is now listed
. Merchants and acquirers can now start integrations.
"The fact that we were among the first to achieve EMVCo approval for our 3DS Server product reflects our leading position in 3-D Secure 2.0. Our partners and customers benefit from the fact that they can access the latest developments and standardizations in this area at a very early stage with Netcetera. For example, merchants can integrate relevant components into their online shop or mobile app in good time," says Peter Frick, Managing Director Payment Security at Netcetera.
Netcetera offers innovative digital payment solutions with a strong focus on convenience, security and mobile use. More than 1,000 banking institutions and payment card issuers rely on the company’s high-quality products for 3-D Secure, mobile contactless payment, digital wallets, risk-based and user-friendly authentication or digital banking apps for optimized banking.
