Presentation by Peter Zuber at Open Banking Forum
 At the Open Banking Forum in March in ZÃ¼rich, Peter Zuber, our Managing Director Financial Technology, talked about the chances of open banking. 
The democratization of data forces incumbents to make proprietary data available to anyone with the owner‘s permission to access it. Open banking is being pushed into the mainstream by four main trends: Regulation, enabling technology, competition and consumer demand. Our expert answers the questions on how the banks are responding and their strategies and on why customers care. Many banks successfully started initiatives already. Banks actively driving open banking will be better positioned to maintain and extend their dominance.
