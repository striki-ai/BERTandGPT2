Netcetera Certified as Developer for Payment Card Issuers
Visa and Acertigo certify Netcetera for Development and Operation of Payment Systems
 Swiss IT service provider Netcetera has successfully passed audits of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) and is certified as a developer and operator of payment systems. This certification guarantees that systems deployed by Netcetera fulfill the worldwide high security requirements of the payment card industry and 3-D Secure. 
Netcetera has a long history as a partner of companies in the payment sector and specializes in developing, operating and maintaining systems for secure payment transactions. The worldwide requirements and standards of the payment card issuers are fulfilled. Netcetera’s systems come into play when credit card customers check their transactions, banks manage their payment cards or secure online shops are operated. For example, for the safe shopping and payment on the internet, Netcetera implemented the 3-D Secure technology standard for various Swiss and foreign customers. Their 3-D Secure systems are also operated by Netcetera.
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) defines the rules for payment transactions. It is supported by all major credit card organizations, and it governs the processing of credit card transactions according to defined criteria and processes. Business enterprises and service providers that store, transmit or process credit card transactions must fulfill these standards and conform to the rules. PCI is based on the
Account Information Security (AIS) program and the associated CISP program, the MasterCard Site Data Protection (SDP) program, the American Express Security Operation Policy (DSOP), the Discover Information Security and Compliance (DISC), and the JCB security rules.
«Credit card payments are not the only area where online transactions must conform to stringent security and reliability levels. Stringent compliance standards are also necessary for card management. PCI certification once again highlights our expertise in payment systems», comments Andrej Vckovski, CEO of the Netcetera Group. «Netcetera has the specialists necessary to develop, operate and maintain such high-security systems and to support our customers in certifications and audits of this sort», he adds. «Now that we have obtained PCI DSS certification, we are able to offer our comprehensive range of products and services to the payment card industry.»
Netcetera implemented the 3-D Secure technology standard for various customers and operates their systems too.
The PCI DSS certification enables Netcetera to offer a comprehensive range of products and services to the payment card industry.
