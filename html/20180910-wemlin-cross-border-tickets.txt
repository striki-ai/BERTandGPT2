Cross-border tickets with TNW Tickets App
Boundless mobility thanks to Wemlin tickets
 Thanks to Wemlin Tickets for TNW: simply buy an international ticket with the app on your smartphone. The TNW Tickets App for BLT developed by us now offers joint tickets between Regio Verkehrsverbund LÃ¶rrach (RVL) and Tarifverbund Nordwestschweiz (TNW). 
Passengers can now travel from any place in the TNW to any place in the RVL and vice versa with just one ticket – for example from Lörrach to EuroAirport or from Liestal to Schopfheim. The app connects 166 villages in the TNW with 178 villages in the RVL. The ticket always costs the same, regardless of whether it was purchased in Germany or Switzerland. Thanks to our further development of the Tickets App, travelers can purchase a single ticket, multi-ride ticket or day ticket for the border triangle even more conveniently and quickly – at a uniform rate.
