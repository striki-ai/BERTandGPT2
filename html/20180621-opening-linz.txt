Pictures of the opening party of our new office in Austria
 In early 2017, we acquired Nexperts in Hagenberg, Upper Austria, to strengthen our local presence in German-speaking countries and to bundle our resources for digital payment solutions. Considering our increasing growth in this region, we are moving to an additional location in Austria. 
We want to offer all our employees a top working environment with plenty of space and the latest infrastructure in an attractive location. Therefore, most of our employees from Hagenberg moved to a larger office in Linz.
Of course, we celebrated it properly. On 19 June, 2018, we clinked glasses with a few customers from Austria at the opening.
