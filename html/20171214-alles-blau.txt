"Alles Blau" podcast by Caroline Palla
Netcetera Cultura supports Zurich artist
 Netcetera supports "Alles Blau", a podcast by the Zurich artist and screenwriter Caroline Palla. In the tiny talk booth in Pallasâ€™ studio, Swiss artists tell their stories. These are not only very personal, but also build on the societal context. 
The artist emphasizes how different her guests are. For example, some see themselves as "part of an artistic collective", others have something of a lone wolf. So far, there are eight episodes of "Alles Blau".
on "Alles Blau": "The one-on-one interview, the personal narrative, is a specific form of knowledge generation in the tradition of
. Each episode of "Alles Blau" is a puzzle piece that contributes to a larger whole. This creates a many-voiced picture of our time, a time capsule that is relevant to us now and for generations to come."
"Alles Blau" is available on this website
in German and can be subscribed to through all major podcast apps (Apple Podcast, Podcast Addict, etc.).
