"Verified by Visa" and "MasterCard SecureCode" now also introduced at Swisscard
Netcetera implements 3-D Secure for Swisscard
 With Swisscard, Netcetera introduced the 3-D Secure technology standard yet for another credit card issuer in Switzerland. Swisscard customers are using the security standards for online credit card payments "Verified by Visa" and "MasterCard SecureCode". 
3-D Secure is the internationally recognized Visa (Verified by Visa) and MasterCard (MasterCard SecureCode) cardholder identification and can be deployed for online transactions. The online payment by credit card is comparable with a personal payment in a shop, where customers sign or type in their personal PIN.
Swisscard is Switzerland’s last big credit card issuer that decided to introduce 3-D Secure with the help of Netcetera. Netcetera is not only specialized in implementations of 3-D Secure, but also hosts this Service for Swisscard, Aduno (Viseca), Paynet Austria and Cetrel (SIX Group).
«We run a multi-client enabled 3-D Secure service in our own data centers. The hosting complies with the strictest security requirements by Visa and MasterCard. This includes for example complex data encryption and an absolute restrictive access to the 3-D Secure servers», commentsThomas Fromherz, responsible for Payment & Card Services at Netcetera.
