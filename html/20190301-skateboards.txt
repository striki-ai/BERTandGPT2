Netcetera Cultura supports skateboard festival
 The Zurich Freestyle Hall has been transformed into a cozy living room, the light is dimmed, the halfpipe is illuminated with spotlights, the food and drinks are ready, and the DJ plays music. 
Since 2014, an annual skateboard and culture festival takes place in Zurich's Freestyle Hall. At the beginning of every winter season, skateboarders of all levels and ages meet to prove their skills. The evening is accompanied by DJs and individual bands especially put together for the occasion. In order to make the 5th anniversary unique, the organizers plan a special cultural program this year. Netcetera Cultura has made a financial contribution to support the organizer in making the event as "cool" as possible.
It's nice that we can also support this project.
