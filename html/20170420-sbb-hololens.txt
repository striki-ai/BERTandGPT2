In addition, the number of passengers could be counted automatically, which would speed up controls and lead to more reliable passenger numbers. This case illustrates the potential of the new technology, but for a number of reasons it is not yet ready for further investigation.
At first, it was not clear which scenarios would provide benefit for SBB. The evaluation and test phase showed that initial uses already exist in maintenance and training. More business areas will open up as the devices are further developed. It is not a question of
