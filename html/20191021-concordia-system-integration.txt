Leading CONCORDIA into the digital future
Secure & high-performance system integration
 We have connected the standard software adcubum SYRIUS to various systems for the health and accident insurer CONCORDIA. In close cooperation, we have created a high-performance and scalable Business Service Layer. This guarantees the secure exchange of master and transaction data with the customer portal and other applications. 
Today's customers expect health insurance companies to offer an efficient digital service as well as personal support. Insurers are therefore required to offer secure and user needs-oriented applications. For an efficient process, the customer portal requires access to customer information in the main system. The secure connection of the outside world to the internal application with the customer information has to be guaranteed. As one of the oldest health insurers in Switzerland and Liechtenstein,
takes the needs of its customers seriously. Data security and the protection of personal data are of paramount importance.
Netcetera solved this challenge for CONCORDIA: we connected the standard software adcubum SYRIUS with other applications via its API bridge. This secure system integration consists of the Business Service Layer, which forms the interface from the main system to various other applications, such as the digital counter, or from the customer portal to the archive. High security requirements, system coupling, transformation of the different data, scalability and high performance had to be met.
An important step for digitization
The Business Service Layer is one of the building blocks that advances CONCORDIA in its digital transformation. Stefan Pleisch, CIO of CONCORDIA, about the successful implementation: "Netcetera and CONCORDIA have complemented each other very well. Netcetera has used its expertise and experience to successfully complete a complex system integration. With it, we have reached an important milestone on our path to digital transformation."
"Such a close and good cooperation contributes a lot to the success of a project. Together we were able to develop the best solution for this step towards digitization," confirms Gabriele Brechbühl, Managing Director Digital Enterprise at Netcetera.
