New horizons in vocational training
 Augmented IT by Netcetera has developed a showcase for the use of augmented and mixed reality in the fields of vocational education and training for BÃ¼hler in Uzwil. 
HoloLens enables students to explore the company’s own grinding machines together directly in the classroom, in 3D and at their original size. They can move freely around the placed 3D object, open the machine and disassemble it, thereby deepening their understanding of its functionality and inner workings.
