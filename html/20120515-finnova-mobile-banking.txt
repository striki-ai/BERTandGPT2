Netcetera and Finnova expand mobile Banking
Strategic Alliance for mobile Banking App Development
', " Mobile banking gains rapidly in importance for banking transactions and the requirements for safety, functionality and ease of use are very high. A continuous development of apps for mobile devices therefore is essential. Finnova AG, Switzerland's leading developer of banking software, has found a renowned partner in Netcetera for the further expansion of its mobile banking apps.", '
’s iPhone app for mobile banking transactions will be extended extensively: In addition to the much improved basic functionalities as asset statement, account and deposit statements, foreign exchange rates and contact possibilities, features for payment and stock market transactions are being implemented. The new app will be available for the Finnova banks during the fourth quarter of 2012 in different languages (German, French, English). The expansion of the interactive functionalities is initiated and financed by Finnova and Netcetera. Since August 2011 the first version of the iPhone app is already in use by several banks.
In an increasingly globalized environment, Finnova’s app offers absolute independence according to the vision "Anywhere & Anytime". With it, users access their banking services and data regardless of time, place, used device or availability of banking consultants. "We pay the highest attention to the interface between man and banking software as well as to the availability of services from anywhere and at any time. For this reason, we invest in innovative solutions for efficient processing of banking transactions", said Charlie Matter, Finnova CEO and delegate of the Board of Directors.
