Netcetera is rail production technology partner of SBB Informatik
 Netcetera and six other technology suppliers were awarded the contract as strategic partners for the railway production of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). 
With technical and technological expertise, the technology partners support the goal of creating an open, sustainable industry solution for the entire rail segment, which will offer more capacity at lower infrastructure costs for the Swiss rail network. In addition, the current Rail Control System (RCS) is to be further maintained and transferred to the new Traffic Management System (TMS) at the appropriate time.
In the area of railway production, the smartrail 4.0 industry program is also being implemented, which is supported by the four railways SBB, BLS, SOB and RhB as well as VöV. The industry program is divided into the programs Traffic Management System, Electronic Interlocking, Localization and Automatic Train Operation and is intended to enable further development steps for the entire railway production.
With the SBB technology partnership, Netcetera strengthens its focus on activities in the segment traffic and mobility.
"Solutions for mobility, ticketing and traffic management are part of our core business alongside payment transactions and the banking world. Netcetera specializes in Mission Critical applications and implements digitization in many industries. It is our goal to gradually implement all successful solutions with which Netcetera is already the market leader in Switzerland, also in Germany" explains Michael Seifert, Managing Director of Netcetera GmbH based in Munich.
